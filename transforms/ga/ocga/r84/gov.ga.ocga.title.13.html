       Contracts concerning the payment of attorney fees and expenses of litigation are generally enforceable. Cheeley Invs., L.P. v. Zambetti, <cite class="ga_app_court">332 Ga. App. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">770 S.E.2d 350</cite>, 2015 Ga. App. LEXIS 238 (2015), cert. denied, No. S15C1298, 2015 Ga. LEXIS 615 (Ga. Sept. 8, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in concluding that the alleged oral agreement for attorney fees was unenforceable and, therefore, granting the defendant summary judgment because some evidence existed that the plaintiff relied on the defendant’s promise and continued negotiating the land deal, all the while incurring legal expenses and losing the value of obtaining the return of the escrowed funds and the opportunity to seek another buyer. Cheeley Invs., L.P. v. Zambetti, <cite class="ga_app_court">332 Ga. App. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">770 S.E.2d 350</cite>, 2015 Ga.

       An oral contract is legal and equally as enforceable as a written contract in an action at law. Turner v. Clark &amp; Clark, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 79</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 323</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2084 (1981).

       Evidence was sufficient to support a jury’s verdict finding a breach of contract in a real estate development dispute, as there was no requirement for the agreement to be in writing where the agreement did not directly involve the sale or conveyance of an interest in land; plaintiff proved all of the essential elements of the breach of contract claim through plaintiff’s testimony and that of another person. Cline v. Lee, <cite class="ga_app_court">260 Ga. App. 164</cite>, <cite class="app_court">581 S.E.2d 558</cite>, 2003 Ga. App. LEXIS 360 (2003).

       Where plaintiff patient sued defendant manufacturer of a surgically implanted medical device, alleging breach of contract, in that manufacturer’s representative orally agreed to pay for patient’s two prior surgeries, manufacturer’s motion for summary judgment under O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-1" target="_self">13-1-1</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-5ol1b" target="_self">13-1-5(b)</a></cite> was granted because while the patient submitted email correspondence patient received from representative requesting all bills for surgeries where representative stated a need for record of what it had cost the patient “out of pocket,” there was no evidence that consideration was given for the promise. Trickett v. Advanced Neuromodulation Sys., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1338, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12921 (S.D. Ga. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in concluding that the alleged oral agreement for attorney’s fees was unenforceable and, therefore, granting the defendant summary judgment because the evidence, including an e-mail, showed that the defendant promised to pay the attorney fees and other expenses that the plaintiff would ultimately incur in responding to the declaratory judgment action and the defendant could have capped the legal expenses by having the land deal closed and the declaratory judgment action dismissed. Cheeley Invs., L.P. v. Zambetti, <cite class="ga_app_court">332 Ga. App. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">770 S.E.2d 350</cite>, 2015 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       Order of the trial court dismissing the plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice was reversed because the plaintiff’s allegations that the plaintiff agreed to oversee the renovation and rehabilitation of certain real property in which the defendant had an interest in exchange for the defendant’s promise to reimburse for certain budgeted expenditures were sufficient allegations to at least state a claim for breach of an oral contract and consideration could be something other than money.

       Unless an agreement is reached as to all terms and conditions and nothing is left to future negotiations, a contract to enter into a contract in the future is of no effect. Such an agreement lacks the necessary specificity and mutuality to be enforceable and, therefore, an absolute covenant cannot be made dependent upon it. Hartrampf v. Citizens &amp; S.

     <p>
      A contract may be either entire or severable. In an entire contract, the whole contract stands or falls together. In a severable contract, the failure of a distinct part does not void the remainder.
     </p>
     <p>
      The character of the contract in such case is determined by the intention of the parties.

       Because the arbitration agreements contained a central promise, favored by federal law, to arbitrate their employment agreement, and an ancillary agreement to initiate arbitration claims within a year, the court inferred from the nature and structure of the agreement that the parties intended for the promises to be separate, so the agreement to arbitrate was severable from the agreement to initiate arbitration within a year, and on this basis the agreements between the parties to arbitrate the dispute had to be enforced unless there was an independent state law basis for refusing to enforce the contract.

       Trial court did not err by denying a county’s motion for summary judgment and concluding that the county’s obligation to provide water and sewer lines under a 2006 agreement was not affected by the Georgia Court of Appeal’s decision in another case invalidating the prepayment of development impact fees under a similar agreement because the invalid portion of the contract regarding the impact fees was severable under the agreement, which included an explicit severability clause.

      In some cases even an entire contract is apportionable, as where the price to be paid is not fixed, or is by the contract itself apportioned according to time; so, if the failure of one party to perform is caused by the act of the other, the contract may still be apportioned.

       A lessor was correct in asserting a right to recover reasonable attorney fees under the lessor’s lease with its lessee as there was no special pleading requirement for the enforcement of such provision, and the lessor prevailed on the lessor’s claim for reimbursement for insurance premiums paid over the life of the lease; thus, the case was remanded for further proceedings as to the amount of reasonable fees the lessor could recover.

       To allow attorney’s fees sought by a creditor would effectively destroy success of debtor’s Chapter 13 (11 U.S.C.S. § 1301 et seq.) bankruptcy plan resulting in denial of debtor’s “fresh start.” To allow such a windfall would also eliminate any possibility of payment of one hundred cents on the dollar under the plan to other creditors.

       One purpose of legislature, in providing that debtor should have ten days’ notice of creditor’s intention to sue the debtor, was to give debtor opportunity of paying note, and thus relieving the debtor of attorney’s fees and costs.

       Legislative purpose of notice required by paragraph (a)(3) is that before obligation for attorney’s fees, somewhat in nature of a penalty, can be enforced, defendant must be given notice that the defendant is about to be sued, so that the defendant might avoid both expense of attorney’s fees and trouble, inconvenience, and costs of litigation itself. Such purpose could not be served by giving of notice after resort to legal proceeding has already been taken, and costs accrued. Walton v. Hines, <cite class="ga_app_court">40 Ga.

       Bank did not have an allowable claim for the bank’s contractual attorney fees in a bankruptcy case because the bank did not provide the debtor with the 10-day notice prior to the petition date; any effort to perfect the right to receive contractual attorney fees would have violated the automatic stay.

    Recovery of voluntary payments.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Payments of claims made through ignorance of the law or where all the facts are known and there is no misplaced confidence and no artifice, deception, or fraudulent practice used by the other party are deemed voluntary and cannot be recovered unless made under an urgent and immediate necessity therefor or to release person or property from detention or to prevent an immediate seizure of person or property. Filing a protest at the time of payment does not change the rule prescribed in this Code section.

       Trial court did not err in granting a contractor summary judgment in an insurer’s action to recover for the property damage a church sustained when the contractor installed an air conditioning system because the action was barred by the voluntary payment doctrine since the insurer paid the church for the church’s loss and had no contractual obligation to do so, and under the church’s policy, the insurer could not recover for a loss against a third party unless the loss was paid under the covered property coverage; prior to paying the church, the insurer had full knowledge of the facts pertaining to the loss, having received several reports from an adjuster, and the fact that the insurer had an assignment did not change the result because it was trying to recover the same amount from the contractor that the insurer paid for the loss.

       There is a distinction between ignorance and mistake of law. Ignorance implies passiveness; mistake implies action. Ignorance does not pretend to knowledge, but mistakes assumes to know. Ignorance may be result of laches, but mistake argues diligence. Mere ignorance is no mistake, but mistake involves more than ignorance. Hence, the statute does not apply to money paid under mistake of law. Whitehurst v. Mason, <cite class="ga_court">140 Ga. 148</cite>, <cite class="app_court">78 S.E. 938</cite>, 1913 Ga.

         Court’s role generally. —

       </h4>
       <p>
        When parties disagree only as to the legal meaning of their agreement, the court’s role is well-defined. When the language of the agreement is clear, then it is controlling, and the court need look no further. This principle is the obverse of the broad freedom of contract the law grants the parties. Smith v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 639 F.2d 1235, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 19213 (5th Cir. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Existence or nonexistence of ambiguity
       
       in a contract is a question of law for the court. Salvatori Corp. v. Rubin, <cite class="ga_app_court">159 Ga. App. 369</cite>, <cite class="app_court">283 S.E.2d 326</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2611 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under state law whether a contract is ambiguous is to be determined by the court. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 519 F. Supp. 60, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15149 (S.D. Ga. 1981).

       Construction and interpretation of a written contract is matter of law for the court and, therefore, is properly subject to disposition by summary judgment. Sims' Crane Serv., Inc. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where no matter of fact is involved,
      
      the construction of a plain and definite contract, if needed, is a matter of law for the court. Crooks v. Crim, <cite class="ga_app_court">159 Ga. App. 745</cite>, <cite class="app_court">285 S.E.2d 84</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2738 (1981).

       In the absence of ambiguities, construction of contract is question of law for court. Suggs v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen, <cite class="ga_app_court">106 Ga.

      <p>
       The construction of a contract is a question of law for the court. If the contract is unambiguous, it is the duty of the court to construe the contract. Smiths' Properties, Inc. v.

      <p>
       Construction of contracts is a question of law for court and where judge sits as trier of fact the judge’s findings shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Nodvin v.

      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the clear and unambiguous language of the contract, it was the duty and within the authority of the trial court to construe the contract. Long v. City of Midway, <cite class="ga_app_court">169 Ga. App. 72</cite>, <cite class="app_court">311 S.E.2d 508</cite>, 1983 Ga. App. LEXIS 2984 (1983).
      </p>

       As general rule, construction of contract is question for court; but where the terms of a written instrument are ambiguous, the instruments meaning should be left to the jury. Illges v.

       Except in cases where meaning of obscurely written words is involved, and where there is evidence tending to show that meaning of such words was differently understood in one way or another by parties to contract, it is improper to submit to jury any question as to construction of contract.

       In an action brought by a lessor against a former lessee, a dry cleaning corporation, for indemnification for remediation expenses incurred in cleaning up the contaminated shopping center property vacated by the lessee, the trial court properly refused to examine a pollution liability exclusion endorsement in a vacuum and, rather, considered that language in concert with other policy language addressing coverage of property damage arising out of the discharge of pollutants and thereby found that an umbrella policy provided coverage for quick, abrupt, and accidental discharges of pollutants. The trial court properly determined that the inconsistent language of the pollution liability exclusion and an amendatory endorsement were ambiguous as the amendatory endorsement narrowed the scope of pollution liability exclusion by exempting from it discharges that were quick, abrupt, and accidental; but the pollution liability exclusion endorsement broadened the scope of exclusion by extending the exclusion to any discharge.

       While court has duty to construe written contracts, new trial will not be granted for failure to discharge this duty if contract is submitted to jury and properly construed by the jury, especially when, if contract had been properly construed by court, construction would have been adverse to plaintiff in error and result would have been the same as reached by the jury in the jury’s verdict.

       It was undisputed that an employment contract provided that the agreement would be terminated “[o]ne year from the date set forth in this Agreement [August 1, 1979].” Since this provision was clear and unambiguous, the trial court did not err in finding that the employee’s employment had terminated by the terms of the contract, notwithstanding continued payments to the employee as “fees for professional services.” Medical Oncology Hematology Group v. Goldklang, <cite class="ga_app_court">183 Ga. App. 788</cite>, <cite class="app_court">360 S.E.2d 41</cite>, 1987 Ga. App. LEXIS 2096 (1987).

       Upon a de novo review of the plain terms outlined in an employment contract, a former employer was not entitled to receive commission payments from its former employee, a licensed sales agent, for deals closed with the employee’s subsequent employer, as any contrary reading would result in an unenforceable contract, under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.43.html#t43c40s43-40-19ol1c" target="_blank">43-40-19(c)</a></cite>; hence, summary judgment was properly granted to the employee on that issue, and the former employer’s claim for money had and received also failed.

      <p>
       In a breach of contract action filed by an employee, who was a third-party beneficiary to an employment contract with a contractor, the trial court erred in granting the employee summary judgment as: (1) under the plain language of the employment agreement at issue between the parties, as well as the county’s personnel policy, the contractor was authorized to terminate the employee based on the employee’s inability or unfitness to perform the assigned duties due to an injury; and (2) the employee could not perform all the job’s requirements.

       Trial court properly denied the former employee’s motion for summary judgment on a claim for breach of an employment agreement and properly granted the former employer’s motion for summary judgment on that claim because the former employee was not entitled to any future compensation from the former employer after the former employee’s termination as the former employee and the former employer entered into an employment agreement with an initial six-month term which was terminable at will.

       Ex-wife was not responsible for paying a portion of past due tax liabilities resulting from the ex-husband’s entry into a voluntary disclosure program because the term “audit” in the parties’ settlement agreement did not include any audits that the ex-husband performed based on the ex-husband’s voluntary entry into an amnesty program as the type of audit contemplated under the tax provision of the settlement agreement was not an audit voluntarily initiated by one of the parties, but one that would be defended against - an audit necessarily initiated by a third party, such as an IRS audit in the traditional sense.

    Rules for interpretation of contracts generally.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The following rules, among others, shall be used in arriving at the true interpretation of contracts:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol11">
       Parol evidence is inadmissible to add to, take from, or vary a written contract. All the attendant and surrounding circumstances may be proved and, if there is an ambiguity, latent or patent, it may be explained; so, if only a part of a contract is reduced to writing (such as a note given in pursuance of a contract) and it is manifest that the writing was not intended to speak the whole contract, then parol evidence is admissible;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol12">
       Words generally bear their usual and common signification; but technical words, words of art, or words used in a particular trade or business will be construed, generally, to be used in reference to this peculiar meaning. The local usage or understanding of a word may be proved in order to arrive at the meaning intended by the parties;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol13">
       The custom of any business or trade shall be binding only when it is of such universal practice as to justify the conclusion that it became, by implication, a part of the contract, except in regard to those transactions covered by Title 11;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol14">
       The construction which will uphold a contract in whole and in every part is to be preferred, and the whole contract should be looked to in arriving at the construction of any part;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol15">
       If the construction is doubtful, that which goes most strongly against the party executing the instrument or undertaking the obligation is generally to be preferred;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol16">
       The rules of grammatical construction usually govern, but to effectuate the intention they may be disregarded; sentences and words may be transposed, and conjunctions substituted for each other. In extreme cases of ambiguity, where the instrument as it stands is without meaning, words may be supplied;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol17">
       When a contract is partly printed and partly written, the latter part is entitled to most consideration;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol18">
       Estates and grants by implication are not favored; and
      </li>
      <li id="t13c02s13-2-2ol19">
       Time is not generally of the essence of a contract; but, by express stipulation or reasonable construction, it may become so.

       When a bank sought relief from the automatic stay to proceed with a sheriff’s sale under a prepetition state court consent judgment that resolved a fraudulent transfer action against the debtor and others by declaring the transfer “void,” the court denied the motion as unnecessary. No interest in the property revested in the debtor because, applying rules of contract construction to the consent judgment, and giving the consent judgment a construction that rendered the judgment in compliance with Georgia fraudulent transfer statutes, the court determined that the word “void” meant void as to the bank, not void ab initio.

       Applying Georgia’s rules of contract construction, derived from statute and case law, an ambiguity in a multi-bank loan participation agreement was resolved in the lead bank’s favor because one section overrode another on the issue of whether to sell the loan in that the contract specifically addressed that issue and so prevailed over conflicting general language.

       Cardinal rule of contract construction is to ascertain the intent of the parties; where a sublease was ambiguous regarding a sublessee’s obligation to pay operating expenses due under the master lease, fact questions remained as to the parties’ intent, and a trial court erred in entering summary judgment for the sublessee but not in denying the sublessor’s summary judgment motion.

       In an action brought by a lessor against a former lessee, a dry cleaning corporation, for indemnification for remediation expenses incurred in cleaning up the contaminated shopping center property vacated by the lessee, the trial court properly refused to examine a pollution liability exclusion endorsement in a vacuum and, rather, considered that language in concert with other policy language addressing coverage of property damage arising out of the discharge of pollutants and thereby found that an umbrella policy provided coverage for quick, abrupt, and accidental discharges of pollutants. The trial court properly determined that the inconsistent language of the pollution liability exclusion and an amendatory endorsement were ambiguous as the amendatory endorsement narrowed the scope of the pollution liability exclusion by exempting from it discharges that were quick, abrupt, and accidental; but the pollution liability exclusion endorsement broadened the scope of the exclusion by extending the exclusion to any discharge.

       Regardless of whether a note’s reference to collecting fees when “legal proceedings are instituted” meant a lawsuit needed to have been filed to obtain fees under the note, a loan agreement signed contemporaneously with the note clearly entitled the lender to attorney fees if the borrowers defaulted on the loan whether or not there was a lawsuit, and, since the borrowers admitted that the borrowers defaulted on the loan, the trial court erred in concluding that the loan documents required the lender to file suit before the lender was entitled to collect attorney fees.

       Insurance policies are prepared and proposed by insurers; and, when such contract is capable of being construed in two ways, that interpretation must be placed upon the contract which is most favorable to insured.

        All agreements should be determined according to the usual rules for the construction of contracts; the cardinal rule in construing contracts is to ascertain the intention of the parties. Crawford v. Crawford, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 187</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 486</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2120 (1981).

Covington Square Assocs., LLC v. Ingles Mkts., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">283 Ga. App. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">641 S.E.2d 266</cite>, 2007 Ga.

       There was not a meeting of the minds that the purpose of the escrows was to provide a fund against which two defendants could recover on their insurance claims; no valid contract was formed and, accordingly, debtor husband’s interest in the escrowed funds was the property of the bankruptcy estate. Also, as to the debtor wife, there was no meeting of the minds regarding the purpose of the escrow, and, accordingly, the wife’s interest in the escrow was the property of the estate. Harris v.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Fundamental rule, which takes priority over almost all others in construing a contract, is to give the contract that meaning which will best carry into effect intent of parties. Paul v. Paul, <cite class="ga_court">235 Ga. 382</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 736</cite>, 1975 Ga. LEXIS 888 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cardinal rule of construction, both at common law and under our code, is, that instruments containing conditions, limitations, and restrictions are to be construed in each case in such way as to carry into effect intent of parties as gathered from instrument as a whole. Emphasis is laid upon fact that technical rules of construction are to be disregarded when obedience to such rules would defeat intention of parties. Wadley Lumber Co. v. Lott, <cite class="ga_court">130 Ga. 135</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E. 836</cite>, 1908 Ga. LEXIS 243 (1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there may be special rules of interpretation which would require that pledge contract be construed favorably to pledgor, or to maker of one of notes so pledged, and strictly against pledgee, ultimate and final criterion, as in all cases, is that real object of court should be to ascertain intention of parties; and that where such intention is clear and contravenes no rule of law, and sufficient words are used to arrive at intention, it shall be enforced, irrespective of all technical or arbitrary rules of construction. Deen v. Bank of Hazlehurst, <cite class="ga_app_court">39 Ga. App. 633</cite>, <cite class="app_court">147 S.E. 909</cite>, 1929 Ga. App. LEXIS 474 (1929).
      </p>

       If contract is subject to two constructions, one which would render it highly speculative and other which would confine its operation to facts and circumstances more reasonably to be anticipated, the latter should be adopted as the one more likely in harmony with the intention of the parties who presumably would not desire in the contract any element of chance that might reasonably be avoided, but would prefer to agree with reference to conditions about which an intelligent judgment might be exercised.

       One of the most important rules in construction of deeds is to so construe the deeds that no part or words shall be rejected. Courts lean to such construction as reconciles different parts, and reject construction which leads to contradiction.

       When two or more automobile liability insurance policies afford basic coverage, but each contains a clause attempting to either escape from liability or become merely excess coverage if there is other available insurance, complete and literal intent of each cannot be given effect, but general intent not to be liable for entire loss is achieved by prorating liability as provided by respective policies.

       Trial court erred in determining that a corporation was not a party to a consent judgment because the consent judgment was ambiguous, and the provision stating that judgment was not entered against the corporation “at this time” since the corporation was in bankruptcy implied that the entry of judgment was contemplated at a later time; the surrounding circumstances showed that the corporation filed a dismissal of the corporation’s counterclaim with prejudice contemporaneously with the filing of the consent judgment, thereby manifesting an understanding that the corporation was included in, and obligated by, the consent judgment, and the corporation was listed as a defendant in the style of the case on the face of the consent judgment.

       Trial court erred by granting summary judgment to a bank because genuine issues of fact existed as to the bank’s obligations under the loan contract such as whether the bank was not to record the security interests assigned to the bank except in the event of a default by the borrower, whether the bank breached a duty to cooperate with the borrower in foreclosing on the properties securing the underlying loans, and whether a duty on the bank to endeavor to timely review loan requests was meaningless.

       Motion to enforce an arbitration agreement was properly denied as a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement did not exist because, although the decedent’s daughter signed a nursing home admission agreement and an arbitration agreement, the decedent did not personally assent to the arbitration agreement; and the daughter did not have express or implied authority to sign the arbitration agreement on the decedent’s behalf as the decedent did not execute any written document expressly authorizing the daughter to act for the decedent, and none of the words or conduct of the decedent could have caused the nursing home to believe that the decedent consented to having the arbitration agreement signed on the decedent’s behalf by the daughter.

       Grant of the defendant’s motion to enforce a settlement agreement was error because there was no unequivocal acceptance of the settlement offer that the plaintiff made to the defendant’s insurer; thus, no binding settlement agreement was formed as the offer specified a particular release that was necessary for effectuating settlement, and there was no acceptance if the responding party did not accept that release.

       When it appeared that defendants, sued as sureties, had requested of creditor an indulgence to principal, such as certain and definite extension of time in which sureties might pay debt, request being embodied in contract tendered by sureties for creditor’s acceptance, upon creditor’s acceptance and retention of papers, creditor assented to terms thereof; and even though creditor did not promise indulgence in express words, such a promise or undertaking on creditor’s part was implied by law.

       Summary judgment was improperly granted to an insurance broker in a contract dispute because there was conflicting testimony regarding the course of dealings between the party relating to whether or not a contract existed under O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-1" target="_self">13-3-1</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-2" target="_self">13-3-2</a></cite>; the question of fact should have been decided by a jury instead.

       Summary judgment was inappropriate in a breach of fiduciary duty action which centered around a verbal settlement agreement as material fact issues remained as to whether: (1) a company’s offer to buy the minority shareholders’ stock required a written purchase agreement; (2) the parties agreed to all material terms; and (3) a note signed by one of the minority shareholders had been cancelled.

       Trial court erred in granting the defendant’s motion to enforce a settlement agreement because an issue of fact existed as to whether the parties agreed during the settlement conversation to a limited release or a general release, which would preclude any potential recovery against the plaintiff’s uninsured motorist carrier as the affidavit of the plaintiff’s counsel that they agreed to a limited release constituted evidence sufficient to create a jury issue.

       An oral settlement agreement as to damages for injuries suffered in an accident was enforceable with a general release provision where the plaintiff’s attorney did not discover the need for inclusion of language to preserve the plaintiff’s right to claim under insurance benefits pursuant to the policy insuring the driver of the car in which plaintiff was a passenger until after they orally agreed to settle the case; counsel’s assent to inclusion of a general release could be implied from counsel’s failure to object when counsel agreed to settle the case.

       Since the defendant’s letter showed in clear and unmistakable terms that the defendant was proposing to sell the defendant’s shares to the plaintiff at a certain price, neither that letter nor another, subsequent one triggered provisions in the shareholder’s agreement which only came into play through the selling shareholder’s transmittal of copies of a written offer containing certain required information, and the plaintiff could therefore not force the defendant to part with the defendant’s shares at a different price than that set forth in the defendant’s offer because plaintiff’s responding letter was a counteroffer, rather than an acceptance.

       Complete and binding contract may be made by means of epistolary correspondence, but this result is not accomplished until there has been a definite offer by one correspondent and an unequivocal acceptance of it by the other, without condition or variance of any kind.

      Conditions may be precedent or subsequent. A condition precedent must be performed before the contract becomes absolute and obligatory upon the other party.

       If condition subsequent becomes illegal, there is no forfeiture; for the estate having once vested, it shall not be divested because party fails to do an illegal or impossible act.

Furthermore, summary judgment was improperly granted to the buyer as the buyer had not shown that the property owner’s defense of impossibility of performance did not exist; and a jury should determine what was a reasonable amount of time within which the owner would be expected to subdivide the property.

The section further provided that the Act was not to be construed to have the effect of changing the age from 21 to 18 with respect to any legal instrument or court decree in existence prior to the effective date of the Act when the instrument referred only to “the age of majority” or words of similar import, except that any guardianship of the person or property of a minor under the provisions of Title 49 of the 1933 Code, whether such guardianship was created by court order or decree entered before or after the effective date of the Act or under the will of a testator which was executed after the effective date of the act, would terminate when the ward for whom such guardianship was created reached 18 years of age.

       Where infant obtains from merchant clothing on credit on faith of false representation of age, and consumes or uses the clothing to injury of creditor, infant, in an action on open account against the creditor, will be estopped from setting up creditor’s infancy as a defense. Unless youthful appearance of infant purchaser or other fact or circumstances appear, such as would reasonably tend to cast doubt or suspicion on truthfulness of infant’s representation as to infant’s majority, it is unnecessary for creditor to make independent investigation thereof. Clemons v. Olshine, <cite class="ga_app_court">54 Ga. App. 290</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E. 711</cite>, 1936 Ga. App. LEXIS 544 (1936).

      <p>
       In order to hold an infant upon a contract, not made for necessaries, it must appear, (1) that the infant was practicing profession or trade, or was engaged in business; (2) that the infant had permission of the infant’s parent, guardian, or law to pursue that occupation; and (3) that contract was connected with that profession, trade, or business. Burden of proving existence of this condition rests upon party asserting validity of contract. Medders v. Baxley Banking Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">17 Ga.

       Emancipation of minor from parental control only gives the minor a right to the minor’s own earnings and releases the minor from the minor’s parent’s control from that time, but it does not remove the minor’s disability and clothe the minor with power to contract.

   However, if the other party was aware that it was contracting with an incompetent, no tender is required. Metter Banking Co. v. Millen Lumber &amp; Supply Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">191 Ga. App. 634</cite>, <cite class="app_court">382 S.E.2d 624</cite>, 1989 Ga. App. LEXIS 754 (1989).

       <p>
        Consideration is essence and soul of a contract;
       
       without consideration there is no life in the contract; it is as the law says, a nude pact, and no recovery can be had upon that contract. O'Neal v. Phillips, <cite class="ga_court">83 Ga. 556</cite>, <cite class="app_court">10 S.E. 352</cite>, 1889 Ga. LEXIS 110 (1889); Monroe v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration means something of value in eye of the law, moving from plaintiff to defendant.
       
       It may be some benefit to plaintiff or some detriment to defendant. Austell v. Rice, <cite class="ga_court">5 Ga. 472</cite>, 1848 Ga. LEXIS 117 (1848); Reynolds v. Nevin, <cite class="ga_app_court">1 Ga. App. 269</cite>, <cite class="app_court">57 S.E. 918</cite>, 1907 Ga. App. LEXIS 211 (1907); Red Cypress Lumber Co. v. Beall, <cite class="ga_app_court">5 Ga.

       Between original parties, consideration expressed in contract is ordinarily open to inquiry for purpose of showing that contract was in fact executed without consideration and is nudum pactum, or that consideration was originally illegal and contract void, or that consideration has subsequently failed in whole or in part. Herrington v. Herrington, <cite class="ga_app_court">70 Ga. App. 768</cite>, <cite class="app_court">29 S.E.2d 516</cite>, 1944 Ga. App. LEXIS 98 (1944).

       It is a general rule that, in order to be enforceable, every executory contract must be supported by a valuable consideration, or, in absence of valuable consideration, by good consideration founded either on love and affection toward one to whom natural duty exists, or on strong moral obligation supported either by some antecedent legal obligation, though unenforceable, at the time, or by some present equitable duty.

      <p>
       Compromises of doubtful rights are upheld by public policy of this state and by decisions of this court, especially when the compromises partake of the nature of family arrangements. Termination of family controversies affords consideration which is sufficient to support contract for such purposes. To render valid such a compromise agreement, it is not essential that matter should be really in doubt; but it is sufficient if parties should consider it so far doubtful as to make it the subject of compromise.

       Fact that agreement for purchase and resale of certain securities allowed either party in good faith to withdraw from joint account before any benefits of enterprise had been achieved, and thus before any equities had arisen in favor of other member, would not render agreement nugatory; in absence of limitation upon duration of agreement, such would seem to be right of either party, even in absence of any such specific authority.

     <p>
      Considerations are distinguished into “good” and “valuable.” A good consideration is such as is founded on natural duty and affection or on a strong moral obligation. A valuable consideration is founded on money or something convertible into money or having a value in money, except marriage, which is a valuable consideration.

        Every executory contract must be supported by valuable or good consideration. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       It is the general rule that, in order to be enforceable, every executory contract must be supported by valuable consideration, or, in absence of valuable consideration, by good consideration founded either on love and affection toward one to whom a natural duty exists, or on strong moral obligation supported either by some antecedent legal obligation, though unenforceable, at the time, or by some present equitable duty. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams Hosp. v. Nisbet, <cite class="ga_court">189 Ga. 807</cite>, <cite class="app_court">7 S.E.2d 737</cite>, 1940 Ga. LEXIS 386 (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the plaintiff’s suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because the plaintiff’s purported agreement to rescind the plaintiff’s request to be named on the deed did not constitute valuable consideration to support the note as the plaintiff testified that it was merely the plaintiff’s supposition that the defendant agreed to sign the note instead of naming the plaintiff on the deed; the note specifically purported to establish that the consideration was the money the plaintiff gave the defendant for the down payment and the repairs; and any consideration for the note was limited to the purported monetary consideration recited in the note. Lewis v. Ikner, <cite class="ga_app_court">349 Ga. App. 21</cite>, <cite class="app_court">825 S.E.2d 443</cite>, 2019 Ga. App. LEXIS 106 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the plaintiff’s suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because the plaintiff could not rely on any prior or contemporaneous oral agreement that the down payment money was subject to certain conditions as the transfer of the down payment money was memorialized in the gift letter, which stated that the defendant was under no obligation to repay the plaintiff and that the gift was subject to no terms or conditions; there was no consideration for any subsequent agreement for the defendant to repay the plaintiff; and the termite repairs money could not be deemed valuable consideration as it was past consideration. Lewis v. Ikner, <cite class="ga_app_court">349 Ga. App. 21</cite>, <cite class="app_court">825 S.E.2d 443</cite>, 2019 Ga. App. LEXIS 106 (2019).

       In the plaintiff’s suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because, while the note stated that it was supported by a good and valuable consideration, it then specified that the consideration consisted of the money the plaintiff extended to the defendant for the down payment and repairs; thus, because the note specified a monetary or valuable consideration, the plaintiff could not rely on a good consideration that was founded on natural duty and affection or on a strong moral obligation to provide the plaintiff, the defendant’s elderly mother, a residence at the house or repay the plaintiff the money to help the plaintiff buy a house of the plaintiff’s own.

        In light of the similarity of the provisions, decisions decided prior to the amendment by Ga. L. 1981, p. 876, which changed the definition of consideration, are included in the annotations for this Code section.
       </p>
       <p>
        Slight consideration is sufficient, and courts of law will not look closely into its adequacy.
       
       Wolfe v. Breman, <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 813</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 633</cite>, 1943 Ga. App. LEXIS 187 (1943).

       <p>
        On principle it is immaterial whether promisor or promisee initiated negotiations which resulted in promise.

       <p>
        Language of section negatives idea that both benefit and injury must occur,
       
       but expressly provides that either, by itself, will support promise. Supreme Court has uniformly followed plain mandate of law, and held that, in absence of fraud, even slight benefit will be sufficient. Crine &amp; Daniel v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">68 Ga. 138</cite>, 1881 Ga. LEXIS 331 (1881); Roberts v. Davis, <cite class="ga_court">72 Ga. 819</cite>, 1884 Ga. LEXIS 327 (1884); Burruss v.

       <p>
        Damage or trouble to promisee, as well as benefit to promisor, is sufficient consideration
       
       to support promise. Mankin v. Bryant, <cite class="ga_court">206 Ga. 120</cite>, <cite class="app_court">56 S.E.2d 447</cite>, 1949 Ga. LEXIS 436 (1949); Zachos v. Citizens &amp; S.

       <p>
        Any benefit accruing to promisor, or any loss, trouble, or disadvantage to promisee, is sufficient consideration,
       
       in eyes of the law, to sustain cause of action upon breach of agreement. Vanguard Properties Dev. Corp. v. Murphy, <cite class="ga_app_court">136 Ga. App. 519</cite>, <cite class="app_court">221 S.E.2d 691</cite>, 1975 Ga. App. LEXIS 1404 (1975).

        Any benefit accruing to one who makes promise, or any loss, trouble, or disadvantage undergone by person to whom promise is made, is sufficient consideration, in eyes of the law, to sustain an assumpsit.

       Trial court did not err in denying plaintiff’s motion for directed verdict predicated on claims that a contract was enforceable as supported by valid consideration since plaintiff did not provide the contract to the defendant for signature until after all the work performed thereunder had been done. Driggers v. Campbell, <cite class="ga_app_court">247 Ga. App. 300</cite>, <cite class="app_court">543 S.E.2d 787</cite>, 2000 Ga. App. LEXIS 1464 (2000).

      <p>
       In the plaintiff’s suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because, while the note stated that it was supported by a good and valuable consideration, it then specified that the consideration consisted of the money the plaintiff extended to the defendant for the down payment and repairs; thus, because the note specified a monetary or valuable consideration, the plaintiff could not rely on a good consideration that was founded on natural duty and affection or on a strong moral obligation to provide the plaintiff, the defendant’s elderly mother, a residence at the house or repay the plaintiff the money to help the plaintiff buy a house of the plaintiff’s own. Lewis v. Ikner, <cite class="ga_app_court">349 Ga. App. 21</cite>, <cite class="app_court">825 S.E.2d 443</cite>, 2019 Ga. App. LEXIS 106 (2019).

      <p>
       In the plaintiff’s suit on a promissory note, partial summary judgment was granted to the defendant as the note failed for want of consideration because the plaintiff’s purported agreement to rescind the plaintiff’s request to be named on the deed did not constitute valuable consideration to support the note as the plaintiff testified that it was merely the plaintiff’s supposition that the defendant agreed to sign the note instead of naming the plaintiff on the deed; the note specifically purported to establish that the consideration was the money the plaintiff gave the defendant for the down payment and the repairs; and any consideration for the note was limited to the purported monetary consideration recited in the note.

       It is no legitimate concern of plaintiff whether consideration, which admittedly was adequate and has been paid, was supplied by grantee at considerable cost to grantee or was donated to grantee by a friend without cost.

       Where mutual promises are relied upon as consideration to support contract, obligations of contract must be mutually binding upon respective parties; and if one assumes under such agreement to do special act beneficial to another, and that other under terms of contract is under no obligation to perform any act of corresponding advantage to former, agreement is without such consideration as will support promise of party assuming to perform.

       Although the insured argued that because of the agent’s representations that the insured would provide retroactive coverage if the insured renewed the insured’s policy with the insurer rather than entering into a new insurance contract with another company at a lower rate, at the very most, the insured’s reliance on the agent’s promise of retroactive coverage cost the insured the difference in insurance premiums; however, this theory of detrimental reliance could not provide the insured with a basis to recover damages in relation to the insurer’s refusal to cover the insured’s crash.

       When an insured was in a car crash after an insurer canceled the policy for failing to pay the premium and an insurance employee allegedly told the insured that the insurer would provide retroactive coverage for the crash if the insured paid the past-due amount, the insurer had no duty to defend the insured because, inter alia, promissory estoppel did not apply since the representations made by the employee occurred after the car accident and after the policy had been canceled for non-payment.

       In a cottonseed buyer’s suit for breach of contract against a cottonseed seller, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the seller as no mutuality as to the contract terms existed since the buyer never obtained credit approval. Further, the buyer’s reliance on the purported promise was unreasonable as a matter of law; thus, promissory estoppel did not apply as the buyer never received credit approval, which was an essential element of the cottonseed business.

       While mere inadequacy of consideration alone will not void a contract, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-46" target="_self">13-3-46</a></cite>, it can support a breach of contract claim. As there was a jury question as to whether a billboard advertising company’s failure to provide advertising for a campground resulted in a partial failure of consideration, the company was not entitled to summary judgment on the campground’s claim of breach of the parties’ sign lease.

       Inadequacy of price not sufficient per se to set aside sale, unless so gross as, when combined with other circumstances, to amount to fraud; but if it be great, it is of itself a strong circumstance to evidence fraud; and this is true where it is attended by any other fact showing transaction to be unfair or unjust, or against good conscience.

      <p>
       Some other circumstance, such as fraud, mistake, misapprehension, surprise, irregularity, or anything else which conduces to inadequacy of price, will be readily seized upon to void agreement when inadequacy is such as to shock the moral sense.

       Mere inadequacy of consideration in deed from husband to wife, even if he was insolvent at time of its execution, will not of itself void deed at instance of creditors, if there was no intention to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors.

      <p>
       Generally speaking, mere inadequacy of consideration alone will not void contract, and inadequacy of price is no ground for rescission of contract of sale, unless it is so gross as combined with other circumstances to amount to fraud. However, these principles of law are not controlling if, as in instant case, issues involved affect creditor attacking deed executed by the debtor to third person, on ground of fraud.

       When, in an action for damages for the breach of a contract, there was nothing in the plea filed by the defendants with reference either to fraud or inadequacy of consideration, the law was not applicable in determining the amount of damages which should be awarded to the plaintiff.

       Trial court properly granted summary judgment to the appellee on the appellee’s suit to recover on a promissory note executed by the appellant because the appellant could not show a partial failure of consideration when there was no consideration wholly valueless as to any part of the promissory note but, instead, as alleged by the appellant, the consideration was simply inadequate in point of actual total value to the note.

       Offending party, in action at law against maker, is not entitled to recover anything upon instrument, where defendant sets up alteration as defense.

       To avail oneself of right to treat note as void because of alterations, maker must elect to rescind whole contract of which note forms a part. One cannot enforce for one’s benefit a portion of that contract, and repudiate another portion of the contract. Glover v.

       Before alteration in written instrument will vitiate whole instrument, three things must appear: Alteration must be material, must have been made by one claiming benefit under it, and must have been made with intent to defraud. Unless all three of these things appear, contract as originally executed will be enforced, if it can be discovered and is still capable of execution. Lowry v.

     <p>
      Where parties, in the course of the execution of a contract, depart from its terms and pay or receive money under such departure, before either can recover for failure to pursue the letter of the agreement, reasonable notice must be given to the other of intention to rely on the exact terms of the agreement. The contract will be suspended by the departure until such notice.

       Waiver results from relinquishment of known right, and where, by course of conduct, one leads another to believe that one will not insist upon strict terms of contract, one will not be heard to complain because other contracting party relies upon one’s acquiescence as evidenced by course of conduct in similar situations.

       As a general rule, a party to a contract may not waive stipulations in favor of the other party, or rights to which the other party is entitled.

       While distinct stipulation in contract may be waived by conduct of parties, it must appear that it was intention of parties to treat such stipulations as no longer binding.

       While it is true that where parties, in course of performance of contract, depart from the contract’s terms and pay or receive money under such departure, modification by way of quasi new agreement will be implied, in order for this rule to have application, it is necessary that circumstances be such as will in law imply a mutual new agreement, so that modification, when taken in connection with original contract, will provide new and distinct agreement complete in its terms. Morrison v. Roberts, <cite class="ga_court">195 Ga. 45</cite>, <cite class="app_court">23 S.E.2d 164</cite>, 1942 Ga. LEXIS 699 (1942).

       By reinstating insurance coverage “without interruption” upon receipt of the premium on several previous occasions after the policy had supposedly been cancelled for nonpayment of premium, the insurer may have led the insured to believe the insurer would continue to follow this practice in the future, thereby creating a quasi-new agreement with the insured to that effect. The issue, then, was not whether the insurance was properly cancelled for nonpayment of premium but whether, as a result of a quasi-new agreement created by the past conduct of the parties, the policy was reinstated following such cancellation.

       In a civil action arising from a creditor’s repossession of a debtor’s vehicle, summary judgment on a debtor’s conversion and punitive damages claims against a creditor was reversed as the trial court erroneously found that the debtor’s failure to demand that the creditor return the subject vehicle was fatal to the claim, given that the creditor wrongfully repossessed and then sold the car subject to the parties’ finance agreement, and hence no demand was necessary; moreover, by repeatedly accepting late payments, the creditor could have willingly departed from the terms of the agreement and thus be precluded from enforcing the strict letter of the agreement without first giving reasonable notice to the debtor of the creditor’s intent to do so, and there was evidence on which a jury could find that the creditor’s failure to give the debtor reasonable notice of the creditor’s intent to strictly enforce the payment provisions rendered the repossession and subsequent sale unlawful.

      for other party must be given reasonable opportunity to cure any deviations from exact terms before foreclosure can be commenced due to defaults which were tolerated under quasi new agreement.

       Mere assumption of debt by third party is not sufficient to establish novation since it is essential that intention to release first obligor and extinguish the obligor’s liability should definitely appear.

        Law leans against destruction of contracts on ground of uncertainty,
       
       and a contract which is originally and inherently too indefinite may later acquire precision and become enforceable by virtue of the subsequent acts, words, or conduct of the parties. Thus, the objection of indefiniteness may be obviated by performance and acceptance of performance. M.W. Buttrill, Inc. v. Air Conditioning Contractors, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga.

       Even though a contract may be lacking in mutuality or definiteness, on account of the uncertainty, still when that party has entered into performance of the contract, and the other party has accepted as fulfilling the terms of the proposal, the contract becomes mutual, binding, and enforceable.

       World War II can in no sense be said to be an act of God. War is not an unforeseen casualty or misfortune; on the contrary, war is something which may be anticipated, as unpleasant as it is to do so, and against which parties can protect themselves by contract.

       If the plaintiff contracts to perform covenants that are impossible, not because of an act of God or the conduct of the defendant, the failure to perform such covenants is as fatal to the plaintiff’s right to recover as a breach of the contract for any other reason. J.C. Penney Co. v. Davis &amp; Davis, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 169</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 461</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2113 (1981).

       Defendants in a contract dispute could not defend their failure to continue to honor merchant referral requirements in the parties’ contract on impossibility grounds because defendants failed to identify evidence showing that performance of their obligations was “impossible” as defined by O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c04s13-4-21" target="_self">13-4-21</a></cite> or the doctrine of impossibility. In fact, defendants did continue with referrals for approximately a year after the merger at issue. Elavon, Inc. v. Wachovia Bank, NA, 841 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152004 (N.D.

The tender must be certain and unconditional, except for a receipt in full or delivery of the obligation, and may be made by an agent and to an agent authorized to receive. The tender must be in full payment of the specific debt, and not in part, and may be made at any time before trial. If tender is rejected on grounds unrelated to informality, informality cannot afterward be raised in objection to the tender.

      </h4>
      <p>
       When creditor refuses to accept proper tender, claim is not extinguished, nor is debtor harmed by refusal. Debtor still has the debtor’s money. The debtor may lend it or use it in business. If, however, the debtor wishes to stop running of interest, or to prevent accrual of costs, the debtor must keep the tender good. But where creditor has collateral, mortgage, or other form of security upon property of debtor, failure to accept legal tender discharges lien which was intended to secure payment. Bourquin v. Bourquin, <cite class="ga_court">120 Ga. 115</cite>, <cite class="app_court">47 S.E. 639</cite>, 1904 Ga. LEXIS 457 (1904); Ragan v. Newton, <cite class="ga_app_court">27 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       When creditor refuses to accept proper tender in payment of debt, refusal does not extinguish debt, but creditor loses collateral benefits under security deed given to secure the debt; however, if proper tender is refused by creditor under claim of right bona fide because of mistake on creditor’s part as to creditor’s legal rights, refusal does not operate as discharge of security. Lanier v. Mandeville Mills, <cite class="ga_court">183 Ga. 716</cite>, <cite class="app_court">189 S.E. 532</cite>, 1937 Ga. LEXIS 393 (1937).

       Refusal of creditor to accept proper tender in payment of debt does not extinguish debt, but creditor loses collateral benefits under deed given to secure debt. Ward v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of proper tender discharges lien. Creditor, by refusing to accept, does not forfeit the creditor’s right to the thing tendered, but the creditor does lose all collateral benefits or securities. Lanier v.

       When principal has placed agent in such situation that person of ordinary prudence, conversant with business usages and nature of particular business is justified in assuming that such agent has authority to perform a particular act and deals with agent upon that assumption, principal is estopped as against such third person from denying the agent’s authority; one will not be permitted to prove that agent’s authority was, in fact, less extensive than that with which the agent apparently was clothed.

      <p>
       While it is true that fraud vitiates a contract, a contract is nevertheless voidable only at instance of person defrauded. Jordy v. Dunlevie, <cite class="ga_court">139 Ga. 325</cite>, <cite class="app_court">77 S.E. 162</cite>, 1913 Ga. LEXIS 421 (1913).

      <p>
       When fraud is discovered, party defrauded is put to one’s election to disaffirm contract;

      <p>
       Fraud may exist from misrepresentation by either party, made with design to deceive, or which does actually deceive the other party, and in the latter case renders sale voidable at election of party injured. McBurney v. Woodward, <cite class="ga_app_court">84 Ga. App. 807</cite>, <cite class="app_court">67 S.E.2d 398</cite>, 1951 Ga. App. LEXIS 802 (1951).

      </h4>
      <p>
       In the absence of special circumstances, one must exercise ordinary diligence in making an independent verification of contractual terms and representations. Failure to do so will bar an action based on fraud. Hubert v. Beale Roofing, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 145</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 336</cite>, 1981 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       In order to show fraud and misrepresentation in the procurement of the contract as a defense to an action on the contract, it must be shown that the defendant exercised due care to discover the fraud and that the defendant relied upon the false representations to the defendant’s injury. Bimbo Bldrs., Inc. v. Stubbs Properties, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 280</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 730</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2277 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to show fraud and misrepresentation in the procurement of the contract as a defense to an action on the contract, it is not sufficient to show that false representations were made, which were known to be false and which were made with the intention to deceive. It must also be shown that the defendant exercised due care to discover the fraud. Charter Medical Mgt. Co. v. Ware Manor, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">159 Ga. App. 378</cite>, <cite class="app_court">283 S.E.2d 330</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2614 (1981).

      <p>
       In a consumer’s suit against a car dealer for rescission, regarding the sale of a used car which the dealer’s salesperson falsely represented had not been in a wreck, it was error for the trial court to grant a directed verdict to the dealer because whether the consumer reasonably relied on the salesperson’s representation was a jury question. Mitchell v. Backus Cadillac-Pontiac, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">274 Ga. App. 330</cite>, <cite class="app_court">618 S.E.2d 87</cite>, 2005 Ga.

       When parties have equal opportunities for knowing the truth,
      
      a party grossly failing to inform oneself must take the consequence of one’s own neglect. A party may not voluntarily accept the statements and representations of another and act thereon, instead of looking personally, and then obtain relief in equity from the obligation which the person assumes. Bimbo Bldrs., Inc. v. Stubbs Properties, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 280</cite>, <cite class="app_court">279 S.E.2d 730</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2277 (1981).

       Party to a contract who can read must read or show legal excuse for not doing so
      
      and, ordinarily, if fraud is the excuse, it must be such fraud as to prevent the party from reading. Curtis v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 379</cite>, <cite class="app_court">280 S.E.2d 404</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2216 (1981).

       One who has been fraudulently induced to purchase property may, after discovering fraud, affirm contract and sue for damages resulting from fraud, or he may rescind contract for fraud and, after offering to restore, recover purchase price which one has paid.

       The buyer’s misrepresentations became a part of the contract for the sale of a motel and a consideration for the contract so that there was no merger or waiver for purposes of determining if the seller could maintain a claim for fraud in the inducement, where the buyer’s misrepresentations as to the buyer’s financial condition induced the seller to change the seller’s position to the seller’s detriment by refinancing a loan and incur substantial loan closing costs so that it could be assumed by the buyer, who subsequently refused to close.

       Daughter’s complaint against an heir seeking to rescind a release of claims against an estate was properly dismissed where the daughter admitted in the complaint that the daughter failed to tender the return of the funds paid as consideration for the release; it was disputed whether the daughter would have received anything for the claim against the estate, and tender was not impossible as the daughter could have paid the heir individually, or could have paid the money into the registry fund of either the probate court or the trial court where the daughter filed the rescission complaint.

       In a consumer’s suit against a car dealer for rescission, regarding the sale of a used car which the dealer’s salesperson falsely represented had not been in a wreck, it was error for the trial court to grant a directed verdict to the dealer based on the fact that the consumer still had possession of the car because the consumer was not necessarily required to return the car, and there was evidence that the consumer’s attempt to return the car was refused by the dealer.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The equitable right to restoration upon the rescission of a contract rests upon the doctrine that a party who has received from another anything of value by virtue of a contract cannot rescind the contract without restoring whatever thing of value one has so gotten. Jones v. Gaskins, <cite class="ga_court">248 Ga. 510</cite>, <cite class="app_court">284 S.E.2d 398</cite>, 1981 Ga. LEXIS 1079 (1981).

       O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c04s13-4-62" target="_self">13-4-62</a></cite> contains no express statutory requirement for restoration as a condition precedent

      </p>
      <p>
       Letter referring to rescission,
      
      but plainly indicating that the subject of rescission was under negotiation, was not a rescission of the contract. Southern Prestige Homes, Inc. v. Moscoso, <cite class="ga_app_court">243 Ga. App. 412</cite>, <cite class="app_court">532 S.E.2d 122</cite>, 2000 Ga. App. LEXIS 388 (2000).

      <p>
       Rescission and restitution are available remedies for material nonperformance or breach in certain situations,
      
      but various rules govern situations in which these remedies will be granted. Cutcliffe v. Chesnut, <cite class="ga_app_court">122 Ga. App. 195</cite>, <cite class="app_court">176 S.E.2d 607</cite>, 1970 Ga. App. LEXIS 833 (1970).

       When money is paid on contract which is executory on part of one who receives money, and party so receiving fails to fulfill one’s part of the contract, the injured party may elect either to bring action on contract and recover damages for nonperformance, or to consider contract as rescinded and recover money paid. Marietta Publishing Co. v. Times Publishing Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">26 Ga. App. 752</cite>, <cite class="app_court">107 S.E. 270</cite>, 1921 Ga. App. LEXIS 627 (1921); Cutcliffe v.

       Rescission of a contract was inappropriate under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c04s13-4-62" target="_self">13-4-62</a></cite> because the purchasers premised the purchasers’ rescission for nonperformance claim upon the failure of a contingency that acted as a condition precedent in a purchase agreement and the failure to satisfy the condition precedent, that the franchisor would agree to the purchaser’s obtaining the seller’s ice cream store franchise, excused the parties’ obligations and performance under the purchase agreement.

       Doctrine of rescission is based upon restitution,
      
      and it is only applicable generally where restitution can or ought to be made. This doctrine can have no application to case if one party has acquired nothing which other party is entitled to have restored. Henderson Whse. Co. v. Brand, <cite class="ga_court">105 Ga. 217</cite>, <cite class="app_court">31 S.E. 551</cite>, 1898 Ga. LEXIS 484 (1898).

       When contract is rescinded, parties are not to be left where rescission finds the paraties;
      
      original status must be restored, or equivalent therefor must be provided in contract or furnished by law. Eller v. McMillan, <cite class="ga_court">174 Ga. 729</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E. 910</cite>, 1932 Ga. LEXIS 126 (1932).

      <p>
       If a “release” speaks in terms of future or contingent claim, it is more accurately denominated “a covenant not to sue.” Thus, a covenant not to sue is appropriately described as an agreement not to sue, given in exchange for lawful consideration. At the time such an agreement is given, there is no claim in existence to be released. It speaks of future, not of present or past. Since no liability exists, none can be released. Wade v.

      <p>
       Covenant not to sue is different in legal effect from a release, in that where executed to one of two joint tortfeasors it does not release the other, though as to first it leaves the first tortfeasor in as good a position as to ultimate freedom from liability as if that tortfeasor had been expressly released. Atlantic C.L.R.R. v. Ouzts, <cite class="ga_app_court">82 Ga. App. 36</cite>, <cite class="app_court">60 S.E.2d 770</cite>, 1950 Ga. App. LEXIS 1049 (1950).

    </h4>
    <p>
     Assuming as true defendant’s assertion that the defendant entered into an agreement with plaintiff to permit foreclosure and sale of the collateral real property to extinguish the defendant’s debt, this agreement fell short of an accord and satisfaction, since it was unenforceable for lack of consideration, since an agreement on the part of one to do what one is already legally bound to do is not a sufficient consideration for the promise of another. Consequently, since defendant failed in presenting evidence to establish a prima facie case of novation or accord and satisfaction, and since the amount of the deficiency under the promissory note was undisputed, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff.

      Accord and satisfaction occurs where the parties to an agreement, by a subsequent agreement, have satisfied the former agreement, and the latter agreement has been executed. The execution of a new agreement may itself amount to a satisfaction of the former agreement, where it is so expressly agreed by the parties; and, without such agreement, if the new promise is founded on a new consideration, the taking of it is a satisfaction of the former agreement.

       Because a valid general release entered into by home buyer and home builder effectuated a binding accord and satisfaction, barring any future claims between the parties, and absent evidence to void the release based on fraud, buyer’s filed claims in subsequent suit filed against home builder were properly summarily dismissed; thus, assessment of attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion and a penalty for filing a frivolous appeal was ordered.

       If party intends to accept check as payment of demand, that check should be promptly presented for payment, usually within a 30-day period. When in absence of circumstances suggesting contrary state of facts, check, although not cashed, is kept for period greatly in excess of this time, such retention may of itself cause debtor to rely on theory that the debtor’s offer (accord) has been accepted (satisfaction) in which case creditor no longer has right of action for any excess payment due.

       Actual payment and acceptance of lesser sum than due is binding if done with understanding that claim will thereby be satisfied. King v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">59 Ga. App. 450</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 223</cite> (1939).

      <p>
       If debtor remits to creditor a sum of money, less than amount actually due, upon condition, either express or implied, that it is in satisfaction of creditor’s claim, and latter accepts and retains the money, accord and satisfaction results, and this is true whether demand be liquidated or unliquidated, disputed or undisputed. Young v. Proctor, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 165</cite>, <cite class="app_court">166 S.E.2d 428</cite>, 1969 Ga. App. LEXIS 1027 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       When creditor receives and retains sum of money from debtor less than amount actually due with understanding, either express or implied, that it is received in satisfaction of creditor’s claim or demand, the creditor cannot thereafter treat it as a nullity and recover balance, and this is so whether the creditor’s claim or demand be disputed or undisputed, liquidated or unliquidated. Gulf States Constr., Inc. v. Superior Rigging &amp; Erecting Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 187</cite>, <cite class="app_court">186 S.E.2d 588</cite>, 1971 Ga.

      <p>
       If debtor remits a sum of money to the debtor’s creditor, though less than amount actually due, with understanding, either express or implied, that it is in satisfaction of creditor’s claim, and latter accepts and retains it, accord and satisfaction of demand results therefrom, and balance, insofar as the law is concerned, may not thereafter be recovered by debtor in action instituted for that purpose; this is true under the law whether debtor’s claim or demand be liquidated or unliquidated, disputed or undisputed. Vintage Enters., Inc. v. Guerdon Indus., Inc., 365 F. Supp. 465, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11149 (N.D. Ga. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Georgia law provides an accord and satisfaction when a debtor remits to a creditor a sum of money, less than the amount claimed due, and the creditor accepts and retains the money in spite of the existence of a bona fide dispute. Rhone v. State Auto Mut. Ins. Co., 858 F.2d 1507, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 14457 (11th Cir. 1988).

       When there is dispute as to the amount due, and one party tenders and other accepts check reciting that the check is in payment in full of demand, and check is subsequently paid, reception and retention of the check can be set up as accord and satisfaction. Edwards Bottling Works v. Jarnagin &amp; Weight, <cite class="ga_app_court">11 Ga. App. 162</cite>, <cite class="app_court">74 S.E. 1004</cite>, 1912 Ga. App. LEXIS 309 (1912).

       Trial court did not err in granting a creditor summary judgment in the creditor’s action to collect the amount the creditor loaned to a debtor because a check a third party sent to the creditor did not meet the criteria of O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c04s13-4-103ol1b" target="_self">13-4-103(b)</a></cite> for accord and satisfaction when the cover letter that accompanied the check, which stated that the check was payment in full of the debt, was not an agreement between the creditor and debtor but was, at most, an agreement between the creditor and the third party; the cover letter did not meet the statutory language requiring an agreement between “the creditor and debtor,” and sending such a cover letter with a check marked “payment in full,” which check was then cashed, was not an “independent” agreement and was not an agreement between the creditor and debtor. Formaro v. Suntrust Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">306 Ga. App. 398</cite>, <cite class="app_court">702 S.E.2d 443</cite>, 2010 Ga. App. LEXIS 950 (2010).

       Chiropractor’s negotiation of a check bearing the language “Settlement in Full” constituted an accord and satisfaction, even though the chiropractor struck out part of the payment-in-full language and wrote in a restrictive endorsement of the chiropractor’s own which said “accepted as partial payment only.” Rhone v. State Auto Mut. Ins. Co., 664 F. Supp. 1431, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6937 (S.D. Ga. 1987), aff'd, 858 F.2d 1507, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 14457 (11th Cir. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action on a note, summary judgment for the holder was error because an issue of fact remained regarding an accord and satisfaction, given affidavits that the holder agreed to forego collecting on the note in exchange for allowing the holder’s mother to live in a home formerly owned by the holder’s spouse and upon payment of a final interest payment of $1,500 in 1996, with no further requests for payment until 2010. Thomas v. Summers, <cite class="ga_app_court">329 Ga. App. 250</cite>, <cite class="app_court">764 S.E.2d 578</cite>, 2014 Ga. App. LEXIS 661 (2014).

       Although the parties agreed that a promissory note signed by the defendant would satisfy the defendant’s obligation to pay past due rent under a lease agreement, nothing in the record showed, that, by executing the promissory note, defendants agreed to settle any claims the defendants might have had for the plaintiff’s alleged breach of the lease agreement and, in fact, there was no evidence whatsoever that a dispute existed regarding the plaintiff’s alleged breach prior to the filing of the defendants’ counterclaim; to the extent that the defendant’s affidavit revealed that the defendant was aware of possible claims against the plaintiff under the lease agreement, such dispute was clearly “limited to the mind of the debtor,” and, thus, the promissory note did not operate as an accord and satisfaction of any and all claims defendants may have had under the lease.

       In an action to remove a lien on property, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment against the defendant on the basis of accord and satisfaction since it was uncontroverted that the plaintiff and defendant disagreed about the amount plaintiff owed for renovation work before plaintiff tendered a check marked “Payment in Full” to defendant. Kendrick v. Kalmanson, <cite class="ga_app_court">244 Ga. App. 363</cite>, <cite class="app_court">534 S.E.2d 884</cite>, 2000 Ga. App. LEXIS 655 (2000), cert. denied, No. S00C1690, 2000 Ga.

       Evidence supported a determination that the preexisting dispute between the parties was not a bona fide dispute and that the defendant acted in bad faith both in generating the underlying controversy and in its offer to settle that controversy through the tender of a check.

       Contractor’s acceptance and deposit of a check tendered in partial payment of the contractor’s bill for clearing rights of way in a housing development, along with a letter from the developer which stated the developer disputed the amount of work actually performed and that the tendered payment was in full constituted an accord and satisfaction under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c04s13-4-103ol1b" target="_self">13-4-103(b)</a></cite> despite the fact that the contractor endorsed the check “with reservations”; thus, the contractor’s action for additional payments allegedly owed was barred.

       Absent agreement, it is only when there is a dispute as to amount due, and one party tenders and other accepts check reciting that it is in payment in full of demand, and check is subsequently paid, that receipt and retention of check can be set up as accord and satisfaction. Studstill v. AMOCO, <cite class="ga_app_court">126 Ga. App. 722</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E.2d 538</cite>, 1972 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff’s acceptance of a check from the defendants constituted an accord and satisfaction since the defendants mailed letters to the plaintiff detailing the dispute between the parties, indicating that the defendants were tendering an amount less than the total indebtedness set forth under the contract, and stating that an enclosed check, marked “final payment,” constituted remuneration for “the balance of the contract,” and the plaintiff accepted the payment without condition. Bridges v. Mann, <cite class="ga_app_court">247 Ga. App. 730</cite>, <cite class="app_court">544 S.E.2d 755</cite>, 2001 Ga. App. LEXIS 110 (2001).

       Mere retention of stale check, since there was knowledge on part of debtor at time that creditor refused to accept the check in full satisfaction of unliquidated liability, and which was never cashed and was, at time of summary judgment order, in hands of maker, will not support judgment of accord and satisfaction.

       <p>
        When compromise contract is based upon bona fide dispute on doubtful question of either law or fact, there is sufficient consideration to support validity of contract. David v. Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 650</cite>, 1943 Ga. App. LEXIS 159 (1943).

       <p>
        Settlement of doubtful issues provides sufficient consideration to support agreement of settlement and compromise.

       <p>
        Compromise of doubtful claim is sufficient consideration to support promissory note fairly given in settlement of controversy.
       
       Cotterill v. Hopkins, <cite class="ga_court">180 Ga. 179</cite>, <cite class="app_court">178 S.E. 444</cite>, 1935 Ga. LEXIS 210 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compromise of doubtful rights are upheld by general policy,
       
       as tending to prevent litigation, in all enlightened systems of jurisprudence. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="ga_court">36 Ga. 184</cite>, 1867 Ga. LEXIS 23 (1867); David v. Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 650</cite>, 1943 Ga. App. LEXIS 159 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        When fairly made, courts always favor compromise of doubtful rights,
       
       and the compromises are binding notwithstanding it may eventually turn out that point of law was in favor of party complaining. David v. Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 650</cite>, 1943 Ga. App. LEXIS 159 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        To furnish consideration for compromise agreement, contention must be made in good faith
       
       and be honestly believed in. David v. Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 650</cite>, 1943 Ga. App. LEXIS 159 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        To render compromise of claim valid, the matter need not be really in doubt;
       
       it is sufficient if parties consider it so far doubtful as to make it subject of compromise. David v. Atlantic Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">69 Ga. App. 643</cite>, <cite class="app_court">26 S.E.2d 650</cite>, 1943 Ga. App. LEXIS 159 (1943); Hall v. Beavers, <cite class="ga_app_court">78 Ga.

      <p>
       In accord and satisfaction of disputed claim it is not the merit of contentions of either party which determines its validity to support such accord and satisfaction, its controlling factor being bona fides of debtor’s contention, which as a general rule is a question of fact for jury. Nauman v. McCoy, <cite class="ga_app_court">84 Ga. App. 131</cite>, <cite class="app_court">65 S.E.2d 853</cite>, 1951 Ga. App. LEXIS 648 (1951).

      <p>
       Compromise of contention as to property rights, final outcome of which, if settled by litigation, parties consider to be doubtful, furnishes consideration sufficient to support compromise contract.

     There is no liability for interference with a contractual relationship when the alleged interference is caused by the exercise of an absolute right. J.C. Penney Co. v.

      The exemption of a minor from contractual liability is a personal privilege. The party contracting with a minor may not plead it unless he was ignorant of the fact at the time of the contract nor may third persons avail themselves of it as a defense.

       There is a distinction between contract induced by fraud and mere breach of warranty; in former case title does not pass, and contract may be rescinded, while in latter case title does pass, and purchaser is relegated to purchaser’s claim for damages. Nalley &amp; Co. v. Moore, <cite class="ga_app_court">51 Ga. App. 718</cite>, <cite class="app_court">181 S.E. 429</cite>, 1935 Ga. App. LEXIS 448 (1935).

      Since the free assent of the parties is essential to a valid contract, duress, either by imprisonment, threats, or other acts, by which the free will of the party is restrained and his consent induced, renders the contract voidable at the election of the injured party. Legal imprisonment, if not used for illegal purposes, does not constitute duress.

       Contract may be rescinded by mutual consent, in which case surrender by each party of the party’s rights under the contract is sufficient consideration; but it is also possible that party to valid contract might require some additional consideration before surrendering valuable rights under the contract.

       When no part of purchase money has been paid, sale may be rescinded by mutual consent, though purchase money notes have been transferred to third person, provided seller takes up notes in consequence of rescission, and either returns them to maker or holds the notes subject to the maker’s order.

       Although an equipment note was supported by ample consideration when the note was executed, there was at least a partial failure of consideration after that time due to a corporate defendant’s failure or refusal to deliver possession of five pieces of the equipment, or to transfer title to any of the equipment, to the deceased.

       In an action to recover on two promissory notes, because material fact issues remained regarding the consideration given for the promissory notes, creating an ambiguity for which parol evidence was admissible, and as to whether the notes were signed as part of the same transaction, summary judgment to either the lender or the debtor was inappropriate.

      Statute of frauds is no bar to claim of unjust enrichment. —
     </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
     In an action for restitution for improvements to property under a theory of unjust enrichment, the statute of frauds did not affect such a claim since unjust enrichment applies when there is no legal contract. Smith v. McClung, <cite class="ga_app_court">215 Ga. App. 786</cite>, <cite class="app_court">452 S.E.2d 229</cite>, 1994 Ga. App. LEXIS 1359 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     When possession and valuable improvements were relied upon, for specific performance
    
    they must have been by virtue of and on faith of oral contract or promise, so as to take case out of statute of frauds and constitute equivalent of a writing by showing acts unequivocally referring to alleged contract or promise. The burden rests on alleged promisee to bring the promisee’s case within these facts, if the promisee did not show other exceptions under former Code 1933, § 37-802 (see O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.23.html#t23c02s23-2-131" target="_blank">23-2-131</a></cite>) and without such proof the promisee was not entitled to specific performance. Taylor v. Cureton, <cite class="ga_court">196 Ga. 28</cite>, <cite class="app_court">25 S.E.2d 815</cite>, 1943 Ga. LEXIS 310 (1943).

        Purpose for statute of frauds
       
       is to preclude admission of parol evidence to vary, modify, or contradict otherwise clear agreement. However, rule does not apply in cases where instrument merely shows incompleteness on the instrument’s face; under these circumstances, extrinsic evidence is allowed to establish other agreements referable to incompleteness when not inharmonious with basic writing.

       While written acknowledgment of existing liability is equivalent to new promise to pay, and, like such promise, will renew right of action already barred by statute of limitations, or create new point of departure for running of statute, such acknowledgment must meet two requirements: that it shall in legal effect have been made by debtor to creditor, and that it shall sufficiently identify debt or afford means of identification with reasonable certainty.

       In a suit for specific performance brought by a plaintiff seeking to enforce an alleged oral contract to sell real property, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant based on the statute of frauds preventing recovery to the plaintiff; the plaintiff had presented evidence establishing the existence of an oral contract for the sale of the property and that it was excepted from the statute of frauds based on the plaintiff’s performance of paying for the property in full, and thus, issues of fact remained as to whether defendant’s decedent had accepted performance through payments received by a sibling and whether, in light of the plaintiff’s previous tenancy, the plaintiff’s performance was inconsistent with the lack of a contract to sell the property.

       Performance of services under oral contract of employment for part of term is not such part performance as renders it a fraud upon party performing for employer to refuse to comply, by discharge of that party before expiration of term. This is true, notwithstanding person performing services, after person executed contract, and began to render services under the contract, refused offer of employment elsewhere. Morris v. Virginia-Carolina Chem. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 702</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 486</cite>, 1934 Ga. App. LEXIS 166 (1934).

       When alleged agreement is oral, with no set termination date agreed upon, in order for agreement to become enforceable there must be such part performance of agreeent as would render it fraud of party refusing to comply.

       In a suit for specific performance brought by a plaintiff seeking to enforce an alleged oral contract to sell real property, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant based on the statute of frauds preventing recovery to the plaintiff; the plaintiff had presented evidence establishing the existence of an oral contract for the sale of the property and that it was excepted from the statute of frauds based on the plaintiff’s performance of paying for the property in full, and thus, issues of fact remained as to whether defendant’s decedent had accepted performance through payments received by a sibling and whether, in light of the plaintiff’s previous tenancy, the plaintiff’s performance was inconsistent with the lack of a contract to sell the property.

       Part performance relied upon must have not only resulted in benefit to promisor, but in loss or injury to promisee.
      
      In such case, uncertainty of parol evidence is to be endured rather than allow promisor to take unjust and inequitable advantage of promisee. Dameron v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins.

       Trial court erred in finding that a lease-purchase agreement was enforceable because, though the agreement satisfied the statute of frauds, the agreement was invalid for failure of consideration in that the lessee/proposed purchaser never paid the rent owed nor any of the property taxes, which not only invalidated the agreement but voided the purchase option under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-8ol1a" target="_self">13-1-8(a)</a></cite>. Further, the trial court erred in holding that the lessee/proposed purchaser was entitled to specific performance of the agreement based on repairs made since there was no legal authority to support the trial court’s proposition that part performance of an otherwise unenforceable written agreement, as modified by subsequent oral agreements between the parties, transformed the agreement into an enforceable parol contract.

       When a party seeking specific performance of an oral contract to sell realty relies on the principle of possession with improvements, it must be shown that the possession and improvement arose by virtue of and in the faith of the oral contract or promise, so as to take the case out of the statute of frauds and constitute the equivalent of a writing by showing acts unequivocally referring to the alleged contract or promise.

However, the trial court erred by concluding that the property owner had not obtained a parol license to use the strip since the property owner had made expenditures to improve the land and, as to the right of first refusal held by another, the grant of a parol license was not the equivalent to a sale of the property to have in anyway interfered with that right.

        Rule against recovery of vague damages applies more to causation than uncertainty as to measure. —

      </h4>
      <p>
       Rule against the recovery of vague, speculative, or uncertain damages relates more especially to the uncertainty as to cause, rather than uncertainty as to the measure or extent of the damages. Mere difficulty in fixing their exact amount, when proximately flowing from the alleged injury, does not constitute a legal obstacle in the way of their allowance, when the amount of the recovery comes within that authorized with reasonable certainty by the legal evidence submitted. Kuhlke Constr. Co. v. Mobley, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">159 Ga. App. 777</cite>, <cite class="app_court">285 S.E.2d 236</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2806 (1981).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Law always seeks to give a remedy commensurate with injury. Injured party is to be placed, as near as may be, in situation the injured party would have occupied if wrong had not been committed. Georgia Power &amp; Light Co. v. Fruit Growers Express Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">55 Ga. App. 520</cite>, <cite class="app_court">190 S.E. 669</cite>, 1937 Ga. App. LEXIS 414 (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Measure of damages in case of breach of contract is amount which will compensate injured person for loss which fulfillment of contract would have prevented or breach of contract entailed; the person injured, is, so far as it is possible to do so by monetary award, to be placed in position the injured person would have been in had contract been performed. Darlington Corp. v. Evans, <cite class="ga_app_court">88 Ga. App. 84</cite>, <cite class="app_court">76 S.E.2d 72</cite>, 1953 Ga. App. LEXIS 1015 (1953); Bennett v.

      <p>
       Proximate cause concept in law of torts and in breach of contract seems to differ only in that probable and natural consequences of breach must have been foreseeable at time contract was entered into.

       As between a negligent plaintiff and a negligent defendant their respective fault may be compared and reflected in amount of jury award, but Georgia law makes no provision for apportioning degree of responsibility in warranty cases.

       Trial court erred in granting the plaintiff summary judgment on the defendants’ counterclaim for breach of a co-tenancy agreement because the record contained evidence from which a jury could award the defendants’ damages, either actual or nominal, from the plaintiff’s alleged breach as the injured party has a right to damages, but, when there has been no actual damage, the injured party may recover nominal damages sufficient to cover the costs of bringing the action. 6428 Church St. v.

       Trial court erred in denying a customer’s motion for summary judgment in a car rental company’s breach of contract action because the company failed to adduce any evidence that the damages a rental truck sustained resulted from the customer’s alleged breach of the rental agreement; the company admitted that customers were not responsible for damage to rented vehicles that occurred after the vehicles were returned to the company’s possession and that it would have been consistent with the company’s policies and procedures for a customer to return a rented vehicle to the company’s premises and leave the keys in the key drop box, and the company offered no evidence to contradict the customer’s evidence that the customer’s friend returned the truck undamaged to the rental lot, locked the truck’s windows and doors, and placed the keys in the drop box.

       Plaintiff, a surety, asserted (1) that the damages plaintiff sought to recover were a result of the alleged negligent performance by defendant, a construction program manager (CPM), of its contractual duties, including the duty to certify a subsequently defaulting construction company’s payment applications; and (2) that plaintiff’s damages included the cost of remediating nonconforming work performed by the construction company and certified by the CPM; the surety also presented evidence with regard to which pay applications and which specific items on the pay applications they contended should not have been certified by the CPM and the cost to remediate the nonconforming work. Accordingly, the surety presented sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact regarding damages for the surety’s breach of contract claims and preclude summary judgment. Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v.

      <p>
       When evidence authorizes jury to find that both parties are at fault, but defendant slightly more so, so as to give plaintiff a cause of action, a verdict for a small amount of damages is proper and should not be disturbed. Hunt v. Western &amp; A.R.R., <cite class="ga_app_court">49 Ga. App. 33</cite>, <cite class="app_court">174 S.E. 222</cite>, 1934 Ga. App. LEXIS 248 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Damages for breach of contract of marriage
      
      were governed by former Civil Code 1895, §§ 3803, 3905, and 3907 (see O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c06s13-6-4" target="_self">13-6-4</a></cite>,<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.51.html#t51c12s51-12-4" target="_blank">51-12-4</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.51.html#t51c01s51-1-26" target="_blank">51-1-26</a></cite>).

      </p>
      <p>
       Humiliation and wounded feelings
      
      are not elements of damage in action for breach of contract. Harris v. Cleghorn, <cite class="ga_court">121 Ga. 314</cite>, <cite class="app_court">48 S.E. 959</cite>, 1904 Ga. LEXIS 129 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the amount awarded is less than that shown by the evidence,
      
      it cannot be said to be palpably unreasonable or excessive. Thompson Enters., Inc. v. Coskrey, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga. App. 181</cite>, <cite class="app_court">308 S.E.2d 399</cite>, 1983 Ga. App. LEXIS 2722 (1983).

       As the testimony established a possible range of damages up to $30,000, the $13,750 damages were within the authorized range for purchaser’s breach of a contract to purchase house and lot. Separk v. Caswell Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">209 Ga. App. 713</cite>, <cite class="app_court">434 S.E.2d 502</cite>, 1993 Ga. App. LEXIS 987 (1993), cert. denied, No. S93C1775, 1993 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       Jury’s verdict for a vehicle lessee against a dealer in the amount of $10,700 was proper because the evidence showed that the lessee was unable to get a tag decal for the vehicle due to problems caused by the dealer’s error in listing the information for a different vehicle in the lease; there was testimony on damages from which the jury could have determined such with reasonable certainty, including, inter alia, loss of use of the vehicle, higher payments on the lease, a higher residual value to buy the vehicle at the end of the lease, and ownership of a less expensive vehicle than what the lessee actually paid. Cent. Auto Sales, Inc. v. Poore, <cite class="ga_app_court">272 Ga. App. 221</cite>, <cite class="app_court">612 S.E.2d 59</cite>, 2005 Ga. App. LEXIS 257 (2005).

      <p>
       Amount of a jury’s verdict of $48,612 in favor of a builder in the builder’s breach of contract action against homeowners was not against the weight of the evidence because the jury’s actual damage award was well within the range of payment to which the builder was contractually entitled and was otherwise authorized by the legal evidence submitted at trial. Harris v. Tutt, <cite class="ga_app_court">306 Ga. App. 377</cite>, <cite class="app_court">702 S.E.2d 707</cite>, 2010 Ga. App. LEXIS 948 (2010).

      <p>
       In an action by the seller of a gas station against the buyer, alleging failure to make payments on a note, the trial court did not err in finding that the seller breached the parties’ agreement by failing to install three gas pumps, and that the buyer was authorized by the contract to install the pumps and to deduct the costs from the amount of the note. An award of lost profits due to the delayed installation and an award of attorney fees was authorized. Spirits, Inc. v. Patel, <cite class="ga_app_court">350 Ga.

       In an action for breach of a construction contract, since the award was less than the contract price and was not extremely in excess of the actual costs spent to complete the construction project, it was not so excessive as to warrant interference under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c06s13-6-4" target="_self">13-6-4</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Jury’s award of $200,000 in damages was upheld because the award was not so excessive as to justify an inference of gross mistake or bias. Green v. Proffitt, <cite class="ga_app_court">248 Ga. App. 477</cite>, <cite class="app_court">545 S.E.2d 623</cite>, 2001 Ga. App. LEXIS 175 (2001).

       Plaintiff in an action is obligated to take reasonable steps to minimize plaintiff’s damages,
      
      if any, from a breach of contract. Kingston Pencil Corp. v. Jordan, <cite class="ga_app_court">115 Ga. App. 333</cite>, <cite class="app_court">154 S.E.2d 650</cite>, 1967 Ga. App. LEXIS 1099 (1967).

       Trial court stated that even if the court had found that a school breached a teacher’s employment contract, the teacher’s ability to recover the compensatory damages that the teacher sought would have been affected by the teacher’s failure to accept the job offered by the school, which continued the salary and benefits under the teacher’s original contract.

       When a bank was liable to the beneficiaries of a trust for breach of contract for not investing the trust’s assets in treasury bills, the beneficiaries had a duty to mitigate the beneficiaries’ damages, and the beneficiaries’ delay in notifying the bank that the trust’s settlor had died, and in probating the estate, causing the trust to be liable for past due estate taxes, reduced the damages the beneficiaries were entitled to because an “absolute promise to pay,” which was exempt from mitigation, was not involved.

       Trial court erred by failing to grant a directed verdict in favor of a bank against the defendant borrowers and guarantors because the defense of failure to mitigate damages was not a bar to a directed verdict in favor of the bank since the guarantees were absolute and unconditional; thus, liability was unaffected by any action by the bank that could have made the promissory note unenforceable.

       Because evidence was presented that a commercial lessee successfully terminated its lease only because the lessee was forced out of business when the lessor refused to pay for stone the lessor received from the lessee, the trial court properly held that the lessor was required to mitigate the lessor’s damages. Allen v. Harkness Stone Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">271 Ga. App. 397</cite>, <cite class="app_court">609 S.E.2d 647</cite>, 2004 Ga. App. LEXIS 1626 (2004), cert. denied, No. S05C0901, 2005 Ga.

       After obtaining consent from the probate court to sell construction equipment an executrix’s decedent secured with a promissory note, the executrix was entitled to summary judgment as to the tort claims alleged against the decedent’s corporation, after the corporation wrongfully retained possession of the equipment, converted two certificates of deposit, and the decedent’s liability on the notes was extinguished under a provision of a stock sales agreement; furthermore, evidence was presented that the corporation’s failure to release the equipment prevented the equipment’s sale to third parties and thereby constituted a breach of a duty to mitigate damages. Midway R.R. Constr. Co. v. Beck, <cite class="ga_app_court">281 Ga. App. 412</cite>, <cite class="app_court">636 S.E.2d 110</cite>, 2006 Ga.

       In determining whether a provision is for liquidated damages or a penalty, the cardinal tests
      
      are intention of the parties, and reasonableness or unreasonableness of amount fixed, according to certainty and ease or difficulty in ascertainment of actual damages, and according to similarity or disproportion between amount provided and actual or probable loss. National Manufacture &amp; Stores Corp. v. Dekle, <cite class="ga_app_court">48 Ga. App. 515</cite>, <cite class="app_court">173 S.E. 408</cite>, 1934 Ga. App. LEXIS 116 (1934); Krupp Realty Co. v.

      <p>
       In deciding whether contract provision is enforceable as liquidated damages, the court makes a tripartite inquiry to determine if the following factors are present: first, injury caused by breach must be difficult or impossible of accurate estimation; second, parties must intend to provide for damages rather than for a penalty; and, third, sum stipulated must be a reasonable pre-estimate of probable loss.

       Trial court did not err in ruling, after a bench trial, that the contract’s liquidated damages provision was an unenforceable penalty because there was no reasonable pre-estimation of probable loss as no evidence was presented that tied the contract’s stipulated sum — a half-year’s salary — to the probable loss of either the clinic or the doctor upon the other party’s breach; the provision stipulated a single, unvarying sum as liquidated damages; it required that single amount to be paid, regardless of which party breached the employment agreement and regardless of what point during the term of employment the breach occurred; and the clinic president offered no explanation for how the contract’s designated sum related to those damages.

       That the parties agree to deposit a specified sum as security for performance, using language which imports an understanding that upon a breach the holder is to pay such amount over to the injured party without further formality, will generally be held decisive of the intent to stipulate for liquidated damages, though other considerations, of equal weight, may often turn the scale.

       Law permitted parties to contract for liquidated damages precisely because of the difficulty of predicting future events and consequences; thus, the fact that a certain purchaser’s purchase of debtor’s property may have limited debtor’s damages did not establish that liquidated damages of $1 million was not a reasonable estimate of loss if the “stalking horse” purchaser did not purchase the property. Furthermore, the damages flowing from the stalking horse’s breach were difficult or impossible of accurate estimation, and the parties intended to provide for damages. Galleria Invs. LLC v.

       A jury award of exemplary damages to the seller of a house in the seller’s action on a real estate contract against the buyer had to be stricken from judgment, for the action involved neither allegations nor evidence of tortious conduct by appellant which would support an award of exemplary damages.

       Although the relationship between the parties (employer and employee) arose contractually, the employee was not barred from bringing a tort action (and recovering punitive damages) for the violation of a duty flowing from relations between the parties which were created by contract. Atlantic Mechanical Contractors v. Hurston, <cite class="ga_app_court">185 Ga. App. 511</cite>, <cite class="app_court">364 S.E.2d 638</cite>, 1988 Ga. App. LEXIS 141 (1988); Anderson v.

      <p>
       It was error to deny the defendant’s motion for new trial on the issue of punitive damages when plaintiff sued defendant on two counts, only one of which could support an award of punitive damages, but the trial court’s charge did not so indicate and the Court of Appeals was, therefore, unable to determine the count on which the jury hinged the jury’s award of punitive damages.

       Since a claim for punitive damages will not lie in cases arising on contracts, having reversed the tort recovery, the appellate court must accordingly also reverse the award of punitive damages.

      <p>
       Insured could not sustain a claim that the parent insurance company interfered with a policy issued by its subsidiary and induced the subsidiary to breach the policy because the parent company could not be a stranger to the subsidiary’s contractual relations; therefore, the insured’s claims for tortious interference with contractual relations and punitive damages arising out of that tortious interference were dismissed for failure to state a claim.

       Although bankruptcy court found debtor civilly liable to a corporation for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty and to a shareholder for fraud, the court declined to award punitive damages under Georgia law, as finding the debt non-dischargeable was a significant deterrent in and of itself. The shareholder was entitled to an award of attorney’s fees because the debtor acted in bad faith with respect to the debtor and caused the debtor unnecessary trouble and expenses, but the corporation was not awarded fees, as it failed on a substantial amount of its damage claims, and its claims were significantly overstated, which extended the litigation and thwarted any efforts at resolution that the debtor attempted.

      Plaintiff was not entitled to attorneys’ fees because the plaintiff’s request was not supported by the facts as pled in the complaint or by additional evidence at the summary judgment stage. The defendant’s failure to make payments under the parties’ contract did not constitute bad faith as contemplated by O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c06s13-6-11" target="_self">13-6-11</a></cite> and attorneys’ fees could not be recovered on the basis of stubborn litigiousness or on the basis of the plaintiff having incurred unnecessary expense because a bona fide controversy remained as to contractual liability.

      <p>
       To authorize the imposition of punitive or exemplary damages, there must be evidence of willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, or oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of a conscious indifference to consequences. Speir Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Lee, <cite class="ga_app_court">158 Ga. App. 512</cite>, <cite class="app_court">281 S.E.2d 279</cite>, 1981 Ga. App. LEXIS 2285 (1981).

       Plaintiff may recover attorney’s fees if the defendant acted in bad faith in the transaction out of which the cause of action arose, or was stubbornly litigious, or caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense.

       Generally, the expenses of litigation are not allowed

       Expenses of litigation are not generally allowed as a part of the damages, but if the defendant has acted in bad faith, or has been stubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense, the jury may allow those expenses.

       Expenses of litigation are not generally allowed unless it be shown that the defendant has acted in bad faith, has been stubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense, all of which must arise out of the transaction from which the cause of action arose.

      </p>
      <p>
       Any one of these three species of bad conduct may authorize recovery of attorney’s fees.
      
      Acting in bad faith, or being stubbornly litigious, or causing plaintiff unnecessary trouble or expense might in a particular case suffice to authorize a finding for attorney’s fees. Thomas v.

       Right to recover expenses of litigation for breach of contract requires fraud, deceit, breach of trust, wilful misappropriation of funds, or fraud in securing contract, or property thereunder. Lovell v. Frankum, <cite class="ga_court">145 Ga. 106</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E. 569</cite>, 1916 Ga. LEXIS 198 (1916).

       In action ex contractu expenses of litigation are recoverable when it appears that a contract was entered into in bad faith or was procured by fraud, or that defendant had been stubbornly litigious. Bankers Health &amp; Life Ins. Co. v. Plumer, <cite class="ga_app_court">67 Ga. App. 720</cite>, <cite class="app_court">21 S.E.2d 515</cite>, 1942 Ga. App. LEXIS 508 (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Georgia does not normally allow attorney’s fees in contractual matters and thus, attorney’s fees are not recoverable unless it appears that such contract was entered into by defendant in bad faith or procured by the defendant through fraud or deceit. Kuniansky v. D.H. Overmyer Whse. Co., 406 F.2d 818, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 4400 (5th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, D. H. Overmyer Warehouse Co. v.

       In actions on contracts, attorney fees may only be awarded when contract was entered into in bad faith by defendant in first instance, or was procured by fraud and deceit. Canal Ins. Co. v.

      <p>
       When recovery of expenses of litigation is allowed in an action for mere breach of contract because of bad faith, those expenses are not allowed for bad faith in refusing to pay, but only when defendant has acted in bad faith in transaction and dealings out of which cause of action arose. Brooks v. Steele, <cite class="ga_app_court">139 Ga. App. 496</cite>, <cite class="app_court">229 S.E.2d 3</cite>, 1976 Ga. App. LEXIS 1862 (1976).

      because a mutual release entered into between the president, the corporation, and joint tortfeasors specifically released the joint tortfeasors from future claims for attorney fees, but it excluded the president; there was no evidence in the record to suggest that the corporation received full satisfaction of its attorney fees through the settlement agreement with the joint tortfeasors.

       When the gravamen of defendant’s counterclaim was that it was required to defend itself against an allegedly spurious claim, such a claim cannot be made as a counterclaim in the subject lawsuit and defendant could not avoid this rule of law merely by characterizing the defendant’s claim as one based upon fraud. Therefore, defendant was not “plaintiff in counterclaim” and the defendant’s claim for attorney fees and litigation expenses was not viable. Barnes v.

       While every intentional tort invokes a species of bad faith and entitles a person so wronged to recover the expenses of litigation including attorney fees, the evidence at issue did not demand a finding of bad faith where a conversion occurred, but when such was done in an attempt to reimburse the converting party for loans that party made to the corporation and recoup some of the costs the party expended; thus, the complaining party was not entitled to attorney’s fees.

      <p>
       Attorney who sued a former client for unpaid attorney fees presented sufficient evidence on which the jury could conclude that the client was stubbornly litigious and award attorney fees on the evidence that the attorney sent the client bills for a number of years, the client never questioned the bills until after the attorney brought suit, and the client stated that the client’s primary contention against the attorney was being abandoned when the attorney withdrew legal representation of the client and not the bill. However, the trial court erred in denying the client’s motion for directed verdict as there was insufficient evidence to establish the value and reasonableness of the attorney fees which the attorney sought.

       In civil contempt action, the trial court erred in failing to make express findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the statutory basis for the award of attorney fees or the conduct that would authorize the award, and the record contained insufficient evidence of the reasonableness of the attorney fees incurred by the corporation and its owner due to the former employee’s violation of an injunction prohibiting the employee from contacting the corporation’s customers and using the corporation’s name to conduct business on the employee’s website.

       While attorney fees could be awarded to an attorney’s client for the attorney’s breach of a fiduciary duty to attorney’s client in failing to adequately supervise the attorney’s non-legal staff, only those attorney fees attributable to the client’s breach of fiduciary duty claim could be awarded; therefore, when the jury made a lump sum award of attorney fees to the client, the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of what amount of the attorney fee award was attributable to the breach of fiduciary verdict claim rather than the client’s other non-prevailing claims.

       Since the adjoining property owners did not prove their attorney fees as attributable to each of the claims on which the owners were awarded damages and the jury awarded punitive damages to the owners without particularity upon all counts, the award of attorney fees and punitive damages to the adjoining property owners had to be reversed as to both issues, and the cause had to be remanded for a new trial on both issues.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Although the court found that the debtor owed a specific amount to the creditor at the time the bankruptcy case was filed and as scheduled, affirmative defenses of recoupment and setoff were preserved, and the party objecting to the creditor’s claim could assert those defenses to reduce the creditor’s claims if the defenses were permitted under state law (here, Georgia). Whether called setoff or recoupment, it was undisputed that the debtor paid an amount to the bank to satisfy the creditor’s primary obligation to that bank, and it was also undisputed that the obligation of the debtor to the creditor arose when the debtor borrowed money that originated from the bank; thus, under any theory the debtor would get the benefit of the amount the debtor paid on the bank’s debt, reducing the creditor’s claim accordingly.

       Existence of valid right of setoff does not operate to defeat plaintiff’s claim, although it might preclude plaintiff’s recovery of any actual damages, and this is true regardless of the assertion of the setoff as a legal right or an equitable right.

       When defendant asserts a setoff of mutual demands existing at the time of commencement of the action, the setoff must be asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense. National City Bank v. Busbin, <cite class="ga_app_court">175 Ga. App. 103</cite>, <cite class="app_court">332 S.E.2d 678</cite>, 1985 Ga. App. LEXIS 2965 (1985).

      <p>
       In general, parties to a suit are entitled to set off mutual demands existing at the time of the commencement of the suit, but such a set off must be asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense, since it does not operate as a denial of the plaintiff’s claim, but merely allows the defendant to set off a debt owed the defendant by the plaintiff against that claim.

        Distinction between recoupment and setoff. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Ordinarily the difference between recoupment and setoff is of little importance. The scheme of the Code is to recoup where both parties rely on the same contract, and set off where they urge different contracts. Byrom v. Ringe, <cite class="ga_app_court">83 Ga. App. 234</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 235</cite>, 1951 Ga. App. LEXIS 841 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a defendant claims a right to a deduction from the plaintiff’s damages for breach of a cross obligation arising from the same contract, the proper remedy is recoupment, not setoff. Johnson v. Raatz, <cite class="ga_app_court">200 Ga. App. 289</cite>, <cite class="app_court">407 S.E.2d 489</cite>, 1991 Ga. App. LEXIS 952 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plea of recoupment is confined to contract sued upon by plaintiff,
      
      including any cross-obligation or independent covenant arising out of that contract. A plea of setoff is not so confined, but is a defense which goes not to justice of plaintiff’s demand, but which sets up a demand against plaintiff, and which includes all mutual debts and liabilities. Bibb Basket Co. v. Eufaula Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 394</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 310</cite>, 1930 Ga. App. LEXIS 421 (1930).

       While damages resulting from the plaintiff’s breach of a contract sued on may be set off by plea of recoupment, still this right of setoff is not broad enough to include damages alleged to have arisen from plaintiff’s wrongful act in connection with a transaction legally distinct from contract sued on, even though closely connected with it in point of time.

       Although the court found that the debtor owed a specific amount to the creditor at the time the bankruptcy case was filed and as scheduled, affirmative defenses of recoupment and setoff were preserved, and the party objecting to the creditor’s claim could assert those defenses to reduce the creditor’s claims if the defenses were permitted under state law (here, Georgia). Whether called setoff or recoupment, it was undisputed that the debtor paid an amount to the bank to satisfy the creditor’s primary obligation to that bank, and it was also undisputed that the obligation of the debtor to the creditor arose when the debtor borrowed money that originated from the bank; thus, under any theory the debtor would get the benefit of the amount the debtor paid on the bank’s debt, reducing the creditor’s claim accordingly.

        Distinction between recoupment and setoff. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Plea of recoupment is confined to contract sued upon by plaintiff, including any cross-obligation or independent covenant arising out of that contract. A plea of setoff is not so confined, but is a defense which goes not to the justice of plaintiff’s demand, but which sets up a demand against plaintiff, and which includes all mutual debts and liabilities. Bibb Basket Co. v. Eufaula Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">42 Ga. App. 394</cite>, <cite class="app_court">156 S.E. 310</cite>, 1930 Ga. App. LEXIS 421 (1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily, the difference between recoupment and setoff is of little importance. The scheme of the Code is to recoup where both parties rely on same contract, and set off where they urge different contracts. Byrom v. Ringe, <cite class="ga_app_court">83 Ga. App. 234</cite>, <cite class="app_court">63 S.E.2d 235</cite>, 1951 Ga. App. LEXIS 841 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recoupment is confined to contract on which plaintiff’s suit is brought, and does not include all mutual debts and liabilities as does setoff. Burton v. Campbell Coal Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">95 Ga. App. 338</cite>, <cite class="app_court">97 S.E.2d 924</cite>, 1957 Ga. App. LEXIS 798 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a defendant claims a right to a deduction from the plaintiff’s damages for breach of a cross obligation arising from the same contract, the proper remedy is recoupment, not setoff. Johnson v. Raatz, <cite class="ga_app_court">200 Ga. App. 289</cite>, <cite class="app_court">407 S.E.2d 489</cite>, 1991 Ga. App. LEXIS 952 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense based on the federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 1601 et seq., constitutes a set-off,
      
      not a recoupment. Vikowsky v. Savannah Appliance Serv. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga. App. 135</cite>, <cite class="app_court">345 S.E.2d 621</cite>, 1986 Ga. App. LEXIS 1834 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim arising out of distinct transaction cannot be recouped but may be setoff
      
      against suit on promissory note. Hamilton v. Grangers' Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_court">65 Ga. 750</cite>, 1880 Ga. LEXIS 320 (1880).

       Setoff is a defense which does not go to justice of plaintiff’s demand,

       Test of recoupment is whether matter arises out of same contract.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because a purchaser of a bankruptcy debtor’s goods alleged that the debtor breached the debtor’s obligation to provide insurance and indemnification against product liability and asserted recoupment against the debtor’s unpaid invoices, recoupment was not available since the debtor’s obligation to provide insurance and indemnity were not part of the same transaction as the obligation to pay for the goods, even though the obligations arose out of the same contract. Natale v. The Home Depot U.S.A. (In re Krause, Inc.), No. 00 B 71919, No. 01-6574, 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 1404 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. July 11, 2005).

       Plea of recoupment goes to justice of plaintiff’s demand,

      <p>
       Claim for damages arising from breach of contract cannot be allowed by plea of recoupment in defense to action of trover, unless some special intervening equity arises in favor of defendant, such as insolvency or nonresidence of plaintiff.

       In general, parties to a suit are entitled to set off mutual demands existing at the time of the commencement of the suit, but such a set off must be asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense, since it does not operate as a denial of the plaintiff’s claim, but merely allows the defendant to set off a debt owed the defendant by the plaintiff against that claim.

       Although the court found that the debtor owed a specific amount to the creditor at the time the bankruptcy case was filed and as scheduled, affirmative defenses of recoupment and setoff were preserved, and the party objecting to the creditor’s claim could assert those defenses to reduce the creditor’s claims if the defenses were permitted under state law (here, Georgia). Whether called setoff or recoupment, it was undisputed that the debtor paid an amount to the bank to satisfy the creditor’s primary obligation to that bank, and it was also undisputed that the obligation of the debtor to the creditor arose when the debtor borrowed money that originated from the bank; thus, under any theory the debtor would get the benefit of the amount the debtor paid on the bank’s debt, reducing the creditor’s claim accordingly.

       When defendant’s plea of recoupment seeks to recoup against plaintiff’s action on contract with a plea that defendant was forced to spend a certain amount of money to have conveyor system, which the plaintiff erected under contract, repaired due to unskillful and improper manner in which plaintiff did certain of the work, motion to strike plea of recoupment was properly denied.

      <p>
       In action on note given for purchase price of property or in payment or part payment of contract price agreed to be paid for performance of work and labor, it is competent for defendant to set off any claim the defendant may have against plaintiff arising out of performance of work embodied in contract, including damages arising by reason of failure of plaintiff to perform contract in accordance with the contract’s terms.

       While it is true that on acceptance of work by owner after building contractor has rendered entire service for which owner has contracted, the contractor is authorized to proceed to collect balance due the contractor by terms of contract, any damage to owner resulting from negligent performance of contract by contractor is a matter for recoupment.

       Ga. L. 1990, p. 1676, § 2, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: “This Act takes effect on July 1, 1990. As a statement of public policy, this Act shall have general applicability to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Act shall further apply to all remedies sought or granted after the effective date with respect to the subject matter of this Act.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ga. L. 2007, p. 208, § 2, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: “This Act shall not be applied to impair any obligation of contract or agreement entered into prior to July 1, 2007, but this Act shall apply to any contract entered into, extended, or renewed on or after such date.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ga. L. 2009, p. 231, § 4, not codified by the General Assembly, provides that the 2009 amendment becomes effective on the day following the ratification at the time of the 2010 general election of an amendment to the Constitution of Georgia providing for the enforcement of covenants in commercial contracts that limit competition and shall apply to contracts entered into on and after such date and shall not apply in actions determining the enforceability of restrictive covenants entered into before such date and that if such amendment is not so ratified, then this amendment shall stand automatically repealed. The constitutional amendment (Ga. L. 2010, p. 1260) was ratified at the general election held on November 2, 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ga. L. 2011, p. 399, § 1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: “During the 2009 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), which was a bill that dealt with the issue of restrictive covenants in contracts and which was contingently effective on the passage of a constitutional amendment. During the 2010 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HR 178 (Ga. L. 2010, p. 1260), the constitutional amendment necessary for the statutory language of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), and the voters ratified the constitutional amendment on November 2, 2010. It has been suggested by certain parties that because of the effective date provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), there may be some question about the validity of that legislation. It is the intention of this Act to remove any such uncertainty by substantially reenacting the substantive provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), but the enactment of this Act should not be taken as evidence of a legislative determination that HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231) was in fact invalid.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ga. L. 2011, p. 399, § 5, not codified by the General Assembly, provides, in part, that the amendment to this Code section shall apply to contracts entered into on and after May 11, 2011, and shall not apply in actions determining the enforceability of restrictive covenants entered into before May 11, 2011.

       Because a landlord recovered approximately three-fourths of the total amount of the damages the landlord sought, as well as significant non-monetary relief, namely a writ of possession, and the tenant lost on the tenant’s counterclaim and recovered nothing, the trial court was entitled to conclude that the landlord was the prevailing party in the litigation.

       In a negligence and breach of contractual warranty suit brought by a developer against an engineering firm for damages caused by the firm on a project involving the construction of an apartment complex, the trial court erred by granting the firm partial summary judgment and enforcing an indemnity clause in the contract that limited the firm’s liability to the firm’s fee. The limitation of liability clause violated public policy under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c08s13-8-2ol1b" target="_self">13-8-2(b)</a></cite> since the clause contained language that applied to “any and all claims” by third parties and shifted all liability above the fee for services to the developer, no matter the origin of the claim or who was at fault.

      Because the interest in a fee award held by appellee, a law firm’s former attorney, existed prior to the law firm’s later assignment of its interest to appellant assignee, and the attorney’s interest could not have been assigned by the firm as it belonged to the attorney personally, the attorney had an enforceable contractual interest in the attorney’s percentage and the attorney was protected by O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.15.html#t15c19s15-19-14" target="_blank">15-19-14</a></cite>’s attorney lien; the attorney had already sold the attorney’s shares in the law firm and had entered into an attorney-client relationship with the class action plaintiffs before the law firm was associated with the class action and before the law firm assigned the firm’s interest in the fees to the assignee, and the fact that the case involved an attorney-client relationship did not mean that the Georgia Disciplinary Standards and the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct preempted O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c08s13-8-2ol1a" target="_self">13-8-2(a)</a></cite> as to public policy and case law that parties were free to contract about any subject matter, on any terms, unless prohibited by statute or public policy, and injury to public interest clearly appeared.

       is to prevent a building contractor, subcontractor, or owner from contracting away liability for accidents caused solely by that person’s negligence, whether during the construction of the building or after the structure is completed and occupied. Smith v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 639 F.2d 1235, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 19213 (5th Cir. 1981).

        As a general rule, a party may contract away liability to the other party for the consequences of one’s own negligence without contravening public policy, provided the parties’ intention to this effect is expressed in clear and unequivocal terms, and except when such an agreement is prohibited by statute or where a public duty is owed.

      </h4>
      <p>
       In determining whether or not a restraint of trade is reasonable, a court should consider whether it is such only as to afford a fair protection to interest of party in favor of whom it is given, and not so large as to interfere with interest of public. Whatever restraint is larger than necessary for protection of the party can be of no benefit to either; it can only be oppressive and if oppressive, it is in the eye of the law unreasonable. Whatever is injurious to interest of the public is void, on grounds of public policy. Rakestraw v. Lanier, <cite class="ga_court">104 Ga. 188</cite>, <cite class="app_court">30 S.E. 735</cite>, 1898 Ga. LEXIS 304 (1898); Shirk v.

      </p>
      <p>
       If considered with reference to situation, business and objects of parties, and in light of all surrounding circumstances with reference to which contract was made, a restraint contracted for appears to have been for a just and honest purpose, for protection of legitimate interests of party in whose favor it is imposed, reasonable as between them, and not specially injurious to the public, such restraint will be held valid. Scott v. Hall, <cite class="ga_app_court">56 Ga. App. 467</cite>, <cite class="app_court">192 S.E. 920</cite>, 1937 Ga. App. LEXIS 134 (1937); Turner v.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determination of whether limitations in contract restraining trade are reasonable, a court will consider nature and extent of trade or business, situation of parties, and all other circumstances. To be valid, a covenant must be reasonably necessary to protect interest of party in whose favor it is imposed, and must not unduly prejudice interest of the public. The restrictions imposed upon promisor must not be larger than are necessary for protection of promisee. Orkin Exterminating Co. v. Dewberry, <cite class="ga_court">204 Ga. 794</cite>, <cite class="app_court">51 S.E.2d 669</cite>, 1949 Ga. LEXIS 481 (1949), overruled, Barry v.

      <p>
       No better test can be applied to question of whether restrictive covenant is reasonable or not than by considering whether restraint is such only as to afford a fair protection to interest of party in favor of whom restraint is given, and not so large as to interfere with interest of public.

      <p>
       Under the law of Georgia, covenants in restraint of trade may be enforced if the covenants are reasonable as to time and place and are not overly broad as to activities proscribed, taking into consideration interests of individuals in gaining and pursuing a livelihood, of commercial concerns in protecting property, confidential information and relationships, good will and economic advantage, and of broader public policy favoring individual freedom to enter into contracts and to contract as one will.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Under the law of Georgia, there are three prerequisites which must be met before noncompetition provisions in contracts may be enforced without contravening public policy. These prerequisites are that the provision: (1) must be reasonable as to time of restraint; (2) must be definite and reasonable as to territorial extent of duty owed not to compete; and (3) must be definite and reasonable as to nature of business activities proscribed. Farmer v. Airco, Inc., <cite class="ga_court">231 Ga. 847</cite>, <cite class="app_court">204 S.E.2d 580</cite>, 1974 Ga. LEXIS 1258 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       True test of validity of contract in restraint of trade
      
      is whether contract is supported by sufficient consideration and whether restraint is reasonable. Stewart v. American Home Mut. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">107 Ga. App. 105</cite>, <cite class="app_court">129 S.E.2d 367</cite>, 1962 Ga. App. LEXIS 583 (1962).

       A distinction exists between that class of contracts binding one to desist from practice of a learned profession, and those which bind one who has sold out a mercantile or other kind of business, and the good will therewith connected, not to again engage in that business. In the former class there should be a reasonable limit as to time, so as to prevent contract from operating with unnecessary harshness against person who is to abstain from practicing one’s profession at a time when one so doing could in no way benefit the other contracting party. In the latter class such limit is not essential to validity of the contract, but the restraint may be indefinite. Kutash v. Gluckman, <cite class="ga_court">193 Ga. 805</cite>, <cite class="app_court">20 S.E.2d 128</cite>, 1942 Ga. LEXIS 484 (1942); Burdine v.

       Certain agreements in partial restraint of trade are generally upheld as valid, but before the agreements can be upheld the court must find that restraints imposed are reasonably necessary to protect promisee’s business. Thus, restraints must be no broader than necessary to protect promisee, and this surely implies time and place restrictions. Cheese Shop Int'l, Inc. v. Wirth, 304 F. Supp. 861, 1969 U.S. Dist.

       The scope of activities restricted in employment contracts against competition will be found reasonable when there is a rational relationship between those activities and the activities the employee conducted for the former employer. Wesley-Jessen, Inc. v. Armento, 519 F. Supp. 1352, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13263 (N.D. Ga. 1981).

      <p>
       In covenants against competition in employment contracts, if the restraint contracted for appears to have been for a just and honest purpose, for the protection of the legitimate interests of the party in whose favor the restraint is imposed, reasonable as between the parties, and not specially injurious to the public, the restraint will be held valid. Wesley-Jessen, Inc. v. Armento, 519 F. Supp. 1352, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13263 (N.D. Ga. 1981).

       Although restrictive covenants are not favored in law, when the contract is not unreasonable or overbroad and there is strong evidence of and necessity for some protection of employer’s expectations from those to whom the employer’s affairs are entrusted, restrictive covenants will not be held against public policy.

       When a duty has been imposed upon an employee pursuant to contract not to disclose confidential business information upon termination of employment, public policy is swung in favor of protecting these commercial intangibles and of preventing unfair methods of exploiting them in breach of duty.

       Employment contract which contained noncompete and nonsolicitation clauses was deemed unenforceable, pursuant to Ga. Const. 1983, Art. III, Sec. VI, Para. V(c) and O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c08s13-8-2" target="_self">13-8-2</a></cite>, because the noncompete clause was overly broad in that the clause attempted to preclude the former employee not only from performing painting services for prior clients, but also from acting as a sales person in the decorative or faux painting business; there was no evidence that the employer had employed “sales persons” or that the employee had ever acted in that capacity on behalf of the employer, and summary judgment to the employee was proper.

        What constitutes a champertous contract. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       There are two essential elements of a champertous agreement: first, there must be undertaking by one person to defray expense of whole or part of another’s suit; second, agreement or promise on part of latter to divide with former proceeds of litigation in event the litigation proves successful. Anderson v. Anderson, <cite class="ga_app_court">12 Ga. App. 706</cite>, <cite class="app_court">78 S.E. 271</cite>, 1913 Ga. App. LEXIS 721 (1913); Clark v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_court">182 Ga. 56</cite>, <cite class="app_court">184 S.E. 620</cite>, 1936 Ga. LEXIS 282 (1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Champerty is the unlawful maintenance of a suit in consideration of a bargain to have part of thing in dispute, or some profit out of the litigation, and promise to pay expenses or costs, seems to be essential to such a contract. Sapp v. Davids, <cite class="ga_court">176 Ga. 265</cite>, <cite class="app_court">168 S.E. 62</cite>, 1933 Ga. LEXIS 58 (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Champerty is defined as a bargain by a champertor with a plaintiff or defendant for a portion of the matter involved in a suit in case of a successful termination of the action, which champertor undertakes to maintain or carry on at champertor’s own expense. Such a contract is unenforceable between parties. Brown &amp; Huseby, Inc. v. Chrietzberg, <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 232</cite>, <cite class="app_court">248 S.E.2d 631</cite>, 1978 Ga. LEXIS 1153 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       When there is no contract of employment, there can be no champerty or maintenance.

      </p>
      <p>
       Contract for fee to be paid out of proceeds of suit is not champertous.

      </p>
      <p>
       A contract between client and attorney, wherein it is stipulated that attorney shall receive a certain percent for collection of claim, upon or out of amount collected, is not champertous, there being no agreement on part of attorney to bear expenses of litigation, or to save plaintiff harmless from costs, as is essential to make out common-law offense of champerty. Moses v. Bagley &amp; Sewell, <cite class="ga_court">55 Ga. 283</cite>, 1875 Ga. LEXIS 407 (1875).

     <p>
      This Code section was based on Code 1981, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c08s13-8-2.1" target="_self">13-8-2.1</a></cite>, enacted by Ga. L. 1990, p. 1676, § 2; Ga. L. 1991, p. 94, § 13; Ga. L. 2009, p. 231, § 2/HB 173.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ga. L. 2011, p. 399, § 1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: “During the 2009 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), which was a bill that dealt with the issue of restrictive covenants in contracts and which was contingently effective on the passage of a constitutional amendment. During the 2010 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HR 178 (Ga. L. 2010, p. 1260), the constitutional amendment necessary for the statutory language of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), and the voters ratified the constitutional amendment on November 2, 2010. It has been suggested by certain parties that because of the effective date provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), there may be some question about the validity of that legislation. It is the intention of this Act to remove any such uncertainty by substantially reenacting the substantive provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), but the enactment of this Act should not be taken as evidence of a legislative determination that HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231) was in fact invalid.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ga. L. 2011, p. 399, § 5, not codified by the General Assembly, provides, in part, that the repeal of this Code section shall apply to contracts entered into on and after May 11, 2011, and shall not apply in actions determining the enforceability of restrictive covenants entered into before May 11, 2011.

       Maintenance and operation of a slot machine, where persons playing the slot machine may, by chance, obtain money or articles of value worth more than money deposited in the machine, is a lottery or transaction in the nature of a lottery, and the law providing for recovery back of consideration paid under gaming contracts, is not applicable thereto.

      The General Assembly finds that the distribution of equipment primarily designed for or used in agriculture in the State of Georgia vitally affects the general economy of the state and the public interest and public welfare and, in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate equipment primarily designed for or used in agriculture and related equipment manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and their representatives doing business in Georgia in order to prevent frauds, unfair business practices, unfair methods of competition, impositions, and other abuses upon its citizens.

All claims for payment under such warranty agreements made by dealers under this subsection for such labor and parts shall be paid within 30 days following their approval. All such claims shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 days after their receipt; and, when any such claim is disapproved, the dealer who submits it shall be notified in writing of its disapproval within such period; and each such notice shall state the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based.Any special handling of claims required of the dealer by the manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, and not uniformly required of all dealers of that make, may be enforced only after 30 days’ notice in writing to the dealer and upon good and sufficient reason.
     </p>
     <p>
      The minimum lawful basis for compensating said dealer for warranty work as provided for in this subsection shall be calculated for labor in accordance with the reasonable and customary amount of time required to complete such work, expressed in hours and fractions of hours multiplied by the dealer’s established hourly retail labor rate.Prior to filing a claim for reimbursement for warranty work, the dealer must notify the applicable manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor of his or her hourly retail labor rate.The minimum lawful basis for compensation to the dealer for parts used in fulfilling said warranty work shall be at the dealer’s costs thereof, including all freight and handling charges applicable thereto, plus 15 percent of said sum to reimburse the dealer’s reasonable costs of doing business and providing such warranty service on the manufacturer’s behalf.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be unlawful to deny, delay payment for, or restrict a claim by a dealer forwarranty service or parts, incentives, hold-backs, or other amounts owed to a dealer unless the denial, delay, or restriction is the direct result of a material defect in the claim that affects its validity.

This Act is intended to ratify and affirm the validity of such legislation subsequent to the ratification of said constitutional amendment; and this Act shall not in any manner be construed to imply a legislative determination that such legislation was not valid prior to the ratification of said constitutional amendment.”

      The General Assembly finds that the distribution of farm equipment in the State of Georgia vitally affects the general economy of the state and the public interest and public welfare and, in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate farm equipment manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and their representatives doing business in Georgia in order to prevent frauds, unfair business practices, unfair methods of competition, impositions, and other abuses upon its citizens.

     Ga. L. 2011, p. 399, § 1, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: “During the 2009 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), which was a bill that dealt with the issue of restrictive covenants in contracts and which was contingently effective on the passage of a constitutional amendment. During the 2010 legislative session the General Assembly enacted HR 178 (Ga. L. 2010, p. 1260), the constitutional amendment necessary for the statutory language of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), and the voters ratified the constitutional amendment on November 2, 2010. It has been suggested by certain parties that because of the effective date provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), there may be some question about the validity of that legislation. It is the intention of this Act to remove any such uncertainty by substantially reenacting the substantive provisions of HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231), but the enactment of this Act should not be taken as evidence of a legislative determination that HB 173 (Act No. 64, Ga. L. 2009, p. 231) was in fact invalid.”

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that reasonable restrictive covenants contained in employment and commercial contracts serve the legitimate purpose of protecting legitimate business interests and creating an environment that is favorable to attracting commercial enterprises to Georgia and keeping existing businesses within the state. Further, the General Assembly desires to provide statutory guidance so that all parties to such agreements may be certain of the validity and enforceability of such provisions and may know their rights and duties according to such provisions.

        Enforcement of covenants would be against Georgia law and public policy. —

      <p>
       Trial court did not err by refusing to enforce the forum selection and choice of law clauses requiring Texas law to govern an employment contract and by dismissing the complaint because a Texas court applying Texas law would enforce non-compete covenants that were unenforceable under applicable Georgia law and public policy. Lapolla Indus. v. Hess, <cite class="ga_app_court">325 Ga. App. 256</cite>, <cite class="app_court">750 S.E.2d 467</cite>, 2013 Ga. App. LEXIS 926 (2013), cert. denied, No. S14C0459, 2014 Ga. LEXIS 230 (Ga. Mar. 10, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration as to the enforceability of non-compete clauses in an employment contract, the trial court properly granted the competitor judgment on the pleadings because the trial court correctly found that the pleadings showed that the lack of any limit on the scope of the restricted work or the solicitation of former customers were void and unenforceable under the non-severability rule as a matter of law. Lapolla Indus. v. Hess, <cite class="ga_app_court">325 Ga. App. 256</cite>, <cite class="app_court">750 S.E.2d 467</cite>, 2013 Ga. App. LEXIS 926 (2013), cert. denied, No. S14C0459, 2014 Ga. LEXIS 230 (Ga. Mar. 10, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to enforce a choice of law provision in the 2014 agreement containing restrictive covenants and by applying Georgia law rather than Delaware law because a choice of law provision would not be enforced if application of the clause contravened a strong public policy of Georgia; before the enactment of the restrictive covenants act, restrictive covenants in restraint of trade fell within that public policy exception if (1) at least one of the restrictive covenants violated Georgia public policy and (2) such a covenant would likely be enforced by the other state’s court; and the act did not change the prior conclusion that unreasonable restrictive covenants were against Georgia public policy.

       Non-compete provision was supported by legitimate business interests in that the employer had devoted considerable resources to developing the employer’s name recognition and customer base and the employer had a legitimate interest in protecting itself from the risk that the former employee might appropriate customers by taking advantage of contacts developed while working for the employer.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, enforcement of contracts that restrict competition during the term of a restrictive covenant, so long as such restrictions are reasonable in time, geographic area, and scope of prohibited activities, shall be permitted. However, enforcement of contracts that restrict competition after the term of employment, as distinguished from a customer nonsolicitation provision, as described in subsection (b) of this Code section, or a nondisclosure of confidential information provision, as described in subsection (e) of this Code section, shall not be permitted against any employee who does not, in the course of his or her employment:
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an employee may agree in writing for the benefit of an employer to refrain, for a stated period of time following termination, from soliciting, or attempting to solicit, directly or by assisting others, any business from any of such employer’s customers, including actively seeking prospective customers, with whom the employee had material contact during his or her employment for purposes of providing products or services that are competitive with those provided by the employer’s business. No express reference to geographic area or the types of products or services considered to be competitive shall be required in order for the restraint to be enforceable. Any reference to a prohibition against “soliciting or attempting to solicit business from customers” or similar language shall be adequate for such purpose and narrowly construed to apply only to: (1) such of the employer’s customers, including actively sought prospective customers, with whom the employee had material contact; and (2) products or services that are competitive with those provided by the employer’s business.

       Factual issues remaining in restrictive employment contract dispute.
      
      — In an agent’s suit against an insurance company seeking to invalidate restrictive covenants in an agreement to sell insurance products, the court held that the trial court properly denied the agent’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to a confidential and proprietary information provision because it could not be said as a matter of law that the information defined as such did not constitute a trade secret or merely confidential information relating to the company’s business.

       Client-based, no-servicing, non-compete covenant with a two-year duration and a nationwide scope reflecting the scale of the business was reasonable, but the employer was not entitled to summary judgment enforcing the covenant because factual disputes existed as to whether the former employee’s duties as a benefits administrator fell within the scope of O.C.G.A. §

      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to enforce a choice of law provision in the 2014 agreement containing restrictive covenants and by applying Georgia law rather than Delaware law because a choice of law provision would not be enforced if application of the clause contravened a strong public policy of Georgia; before the enactment of the restrictive covenants act, restrictive covenants in restraint of trade fell within that public policy exception if (1) at least one of the restrictive covenants violated Georgia public policy and (2) such a covenant would likely be enforced by the other state’s court; and the act did not change the prior conclusion that unreasonable restrictive covenants were against Georgia public policy.

     <p>
      In determining the reasonableness of a restrictive covenant that limits or restricts competition during or after the term of an employment or business relationship, the court shall make the following presumptions:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-56ol11">
       During the term of the relationship, a time period equal to or measured by duration of the parties’ business or commercial relationship is reasonable, provided that the reasonableness of a time period after a term of employment shall be as provided for in Code Section 13-8-57;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-56ol12">
       A geographic territory which includes the areas in which the employer does business at any time during the parties’ relationship, even if not known at the time of entry into the restrictive covenant, is reasonable, provided that:
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t13c08s13-8-56ol12A">
         The total distance encompassed by the provisions of the covenant also is reasonable;

         The agreement contains a list of particular competitors as prohibited employers for a limited period of time after the term of employment or a business or commercial relationship; or

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-56ol13">
       The scope of competition restricted is measured by the business of the employer or other person or entity in whose favor the restrictive covenant is given; provided, however, that a court shall not refuse to enforce the provisions of a restrictive covenant because the person seeking enforcement establishes evidence that a restrictive covenant has been violated but has not proven that the covenant has been violated as to the entire scope of the prohibited activities of the person seeking enforcement or as to the entire geographic area of the covenant; and
      </li>

       Any restriction that operates during the term of an employment relationship, agency relationship, independent contractor relationship, partnership, franchise, distributorship, license, ownership of a stake in a business entity, or other ongoing business relationship shall not be considered unreasonable because it lacks any specific limitation upon scope of activity, duration, or geographic area so long as it promotes or protects the purpose or subject matter of the agreement or relationship or deters any potential conflict of interest.

      A court shall not refuse to enforce a restrictive covenant on the ground that the person seeking enforcement is a third-party beneficiary of such contract or is an assignee or successor to a party to such contract.

     <p>
      In determining the enforceability of a restrictive covenant, it is not a defense that the person seeking enforcement no longer continues in business in the scope of the prohibited activities that is the subject of the action to enforce the restrictive covenant if such discontinuance of business is the result of a violation of the restriction.

      A court shall enforce a restrictive covenant by any appropriate and effective remedy available at law or equity, including, but not limited to, temporary and permanent injunctions.

      In determining the reasonableness of a restrictive covenant between an employer and an employee, as such term is defined in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (5) of Code Section 13-8-51, a court may consider the economic hardship imposed upon an employee by enforcement of the covenant; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply to contracts or agreements between or among those persons or entities listed in paragraphs (2) through (7) of subsection (a) of Code Section 13-8-52.

        There are two main conditions of bond under the law;
       
       first, to guarantee and insure completion of contract in accordance with the contract’s terms and specifications and, second, to guarantee payment to third parties of work, tools, machinery, skill, and materials.

    Determining Georgia residency for businesses; preferences; adherence to policies and procedures of State Construction Manual; public works construction contracts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of determining residency under this Code section, a Georgia resident business shall include any business that regularly maintains a place from which business is physically conducted in Georgia for at least one year prior to any bid or proposal submitted pursuant to this Code section or a new business that is domiciled in Georgia which regularly maintains a place from which business is physically conducted in Georgia; provided, however, that a place of business shall not include a post office box, site trailer, or temporary structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the state contracts for the doing of a public work, materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and laborers resident in the State of Georgia are to be granted the same preference over materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and laborers resident in another state in the same manner, on the same basis, and to the same extent that preference is granted in awarding bids for the same goods or services by such other state to materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and laborers resident in such other state over materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and laborers resident in the State of Georgia. However, these requirements shall in no way impair the ability of the state to compare the quality of materials proposed for purchase and to compare the qualifications, character, responsibility, and fitness of materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and laborers proposed for employment in its consideration of the purchase of materials or employment of persons. This subsection shall not apply to transportation projects for which federal aid funds are available.

     To satisfy the statutory purpose of a payment bond, a payment bond for public work must include the specific statement that the bond is intended for all persons furnishing work or material for the public improvement or that the contract is to be construed so as to be in accordance with applicable statutes. In the absence of one of these terms, a bond is not a “payment” bond and is not enforceable as such by a subcontractor or the subcontractor’s materialmen. The materialman’s remedy in such a case appears to be against the public body. B &amp; B Elec. Supply Co. v. H.J. Russell Constr. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga.

     If the general contractor’s payment bond defines a claimant under the bond as one supplying material to a subcontractor, then a materialman of a subcontractor may sue on the bond for the subcontractor’s nonpayment; if the bond expressly limits a right of action on the bond to the named obligees or is conditioned on the general contractor’s payment of only materialmen having a direct relationship with the general contractor, then a materialman of a subcontractor may not sue on the payment bond; and if the bond is conditioned on the general contractor’s payment of all persons furnishing labor and material under or for the contract, then, at a minimum, materialmen of the general contractor may maintain an action on the bond.

No public works construction contract requiring a payment bond shall be valid for any purpose unless the contractor gives such payment bond; provided, however, that in lieu of such payment bond, the state, in its discretion, may accept a cashier’s check, certified check, or cash for the use and protection of all subcontractors and all persons supplying labor, materials, machinery, and equipment in the prosecution of work provided in the contract. The payment bond or other security accepted in lieu of a payment bond shall be in the amount of at least the total amount payable by the terms of the initial contract and shall be increased if requested by the state as the contract amount is increased.

This will not affect the retained amounts on the first 50 percent of the work on the project which may continue to be held to ensure satisfactory completion of the project. If, after discontinuing the retention, the department, agency, or instrumentality of the state or any political subdivision thereof determines that the work is unsatisfactory or has fallen behind schedule, retention may be resumed at the previous level.

     <p>
      Final payment of the retained amounts to the contractor under the contract to which the retained amounts relate shall be made after certification by the engineer in charge of the project covered by the contract that the work has been satisfactorily completed and is accepted in accordance with the contract, plans, and specifications. Payment to the contractor of interest earned on the retained amounts shall be made after certification by the engineer in charge of the project covered by the contract that the work has been completed within the time specified and within the price specified in the contract.

      At substantial completion of the work and as the governmental entity’s authorized contract representative determines the work to be reasonably satisfactory, the governmental entity shall within 30 days after invoice and other appropriate documentation as may be required by the contract documents are provided pay the retainage to the contractor. If at that time there are any remaining incomplete minor items, an amount equal to 200 percent of the value of each item as determined by the governmental entity’s authorized contract representative shall be withheld until such item or items are completed.

       Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a subcontractor in the subcontractor’s breach of contract action against a general contractor and the contractor’s surety, arising from the parties’ work on a construction project, as the court interpreted the terms of the parties’ contract pursuant to O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c02s13-2-1" target="_self">13-2-1</a></cite> to mean that the general contractor was entitled to withhold final payment to the subcontractor pursuant to O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c11s13-11-3" target="_self">13-11-3</a></cite> when the suppliers’ bills were not paid, and the general contractor was also entitled to offset that final payment by amounts owed to the suppliers, as the risk of loss was on the subcontractor.

       Trial court properly denied attorney fees to a contractor in a breach of contract suit brought under the Georgia Prompt Pay Act, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c11s13-11-1" target="_self">13-11-1</a></cite> et seq., against a homeowner for the failure of the homeowner to pay for the installation of a wrought iron fence as O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c11s13-11-1" target="_self">13-11-1</a></cite>0 specifically provided that the Act did not apply to contracts involving single family residences and no evidence to support a bad faith litigation award was made. Since §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t13c11s13-11-10" target="_self">13-11-10</a></cite> specifically provided that the Act did not apply, there was no other statutory basis under the Act to support the contractor’s claim for attorney fees.
