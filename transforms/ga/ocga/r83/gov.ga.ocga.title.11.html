       Absent an agreement that the law of another state shall govern, Georgia law applies to the repossession, resale, and right to a deficiency judgment where the collateral was located in Georgia at the time of the repossession and resale.

       In a tort action in Georgia, where defendant’s insurer, a Florida corporation, tendered to plaintiff a draft payable through a Florida bank and plaintiff crossed out the printed endorsement/release before endorsing the draft to a body shop and added a handwritten endorsement reserving defendant’s rights, the lex fori, i.e., the law of Georgia, should be applied where both parties are Georgia residents, since the relationship of the insurer to the parties and the action is that of defendant’s agent for the payment of a sum or sums due plaintiff under the terms of the contract of insurance between defendant and the insurer and the collecting bank is the agent of the insurer. The residence of the agent or subagent is irrelevant, absent special circumstances. Wallace v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga.

       Claimant’s unwritten agreement with an individual concerning a vehicle was not a lease because the claimant offered no evidence that the individual had the right to voluntarily terminate the individual’s payment obligation under the agreement, i.e., to pay less than the full amount of consideration under the lease, or that the individual could purchase the vehicle only after paying additional consideration.

       A buyer who merely knows of a security interest of another party covering certain goods constitutes a buyer in ordinary course of business and takes free of that security interest, whereas a buyer who knows that the sale actually violates some term of the security agreement not waived by the secured party takes subject to that security interest.

       Considering the facts of the case in light of the plain language of the Georgia Code, an agreement giving debtor right to possession and use of a new truck in return for certain payments constituted a lease under Georgia law, even though the contract did not give debtor the power to terminate the agreement prior to the expiration of the term of the agreement.

       The best test for determining the intent of an agreement which provides for an option to buy—that is, whether it is a lease or a security agreement—is a comparison of the option price with the market value of the equipment at the time the option is to be exercised. Such a comparison shows whether the lessee is paying actual value (evidencing a lease) or acquiring the property at a substantially lower price (evidencing a security agreement). Mejia v. Citizens &amp; S. Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">175 Ga. App. 80</cite>, <cite class="app_court">332 S.E.2d 170</cite> (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an alleged automobile lease agreement contains an option to purchase the leased vehicle, the “best test” for determining the agreement’s purpose and the parties’ contractual intent is a comparison of the option price with the market value of the equipment at the time the option is to be exercised. If the lessees can acquire the property under the purchase option for little or no additional consideration in relation to its true value, the lease is one intended for security. If the lessees are required to pay at least a reasonable price, if not a price equal to or greater than the actual value of the automobile, at option time in order to exercise their purchase option, the agreement is intended to be and is in fact a true lease and not a disguised security transaction. Woods v. General Elec. Credit Auto Lease, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">187 Ga. App. 57</cite>, <cite class="app_court">369 S.E.2d 334</cite> (1988).

      <p>
       Factors tending to establish that “lease” transaction is a conditional sale
      
      are: lessor’s purchase of equipment from supplier; requirement that lessee be responsible for payment of all taxes, insurance and expenses for repairs, an initial down payment, and additional payment of security deposit. Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Dowdy, <cite class="ga_app_court">159 Ga. App. 666</cite>, <cite class="app_court">284 S.E.2d 679</cite> (1981), overruled, Adams v.

       Jury verdict imposing liability on guarantors for a debt of a corporation was reversed where there was no evidence that the guarantors wrote their names on or otherwise signed the guaranty, where a witness’s opinion that the guaranty “appeared” to be executed by the guarantors lacked any basis whatsoever, other than the fact that their names appeared on the signature lines, and where the notary attestation was invalid, if for no other reason, because the guaranty did not contain a notary seal.

       A school tuition payment
      
      is a payment for services rather than for the purchase of personal property. The inclusion of such incidental items as uniforms, lockers, books, etc. in the tuition fee clearly would not reduce the essential character of the transaction to a sale of personal property.

     <p>
      A term providing that one party or that party’s successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral “at will” or when the party “deems itself insecure” or words of similar import shall be construed to mean that the party shall have power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against whom the power has been exercised.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated. Such a subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.

       Motor home seller’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law was denied because the buyers presented sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict in their favor as to the state law breach of implied warranty claims as the buyers presented evidence showing that they were the real buyers of the motor home even though the legal transaction was done in the name of a corporate entity and the seller could not challenge the
   buyers’ standing to assert breach of warranty claims because the seller assured the buyers that they were covered under the motor home’s warranty and that the warranty was being honored; testimony of the
   seller’s service manager, that the buyers were entitled to the benefits of the warranty, was sufficient to establish that they were “buyers” under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-103" target="_self">11-2-103</a></cite>.

       In this article unless the context otherwise requires “contract” and “agreement” are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. “Contract for sale” includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A “sale” consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Code Section 11-2-401). A “present sale” means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.

       “Termination” occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On “termination” all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-106ol14">
       “Cancellation” occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of “termination” except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

      <p>
       Article 2 of the Georgia Commercial Code, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-101" target="_self">11-2-101</a></cite> et seq., applied to a contract because the sale of goods, the dirt which the seller offered to furnish to the buyer, was the predominant purpose of the contemplated transaction. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in putting the question of predominant purpose to the jury because the evidence permitted a rational jury to resolve this issue in a way that would lead to a conclusion that the sale of goods under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-107ol11" target="_self">11-2-107(1)</a></cite> was the predominant purpose of the contemplated transaction.

        Contract for sale of standing timber to be severed before title passes. —

      <p>
       A contract of sale for timber which is attached to the soil, but which is presently to be severed and converted into personalty before title passes to purchaser, is an executory sale of personalty, and not of an interest in land. Pope v. Barnett, <cite class="ga_app_court">45 Ga. App. 59</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E. 517</cite> (1932) (decided prior to adoption of Uniform Commercial Code).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Although quantity was unknown at time seller agreed to sell, the contract was binding on seller where amount of “milk base” was determinable under standards set by federal government. The agreement was much like an offer under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-107ol12" target="_self">11-2-107(2)</a></cite> to purchase a growing crop, for while the exact quantity is not known, it is ascertainable and determinable.

        Dirt was a good. —

      </h4>
      <p>
       Dirt was a “good” only if the dirt was severed from the land by the seller, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-107ol11" target="_self">11-2-107(1)</a></cite>, so the separation of fill dirt from the land was a necessary component of the sale of dirt, not the dirt’s transportation to a construction site after sale. Paramount Contr. Co. v. DPS Indus., <cite class="ga_app_court">309 Ga. App. 113</cite>, <cite class="app_court">709 S.E.2d 288</cite> (2011), cert. denied, No. S11C1216, 2011 Ga. LEXIS 607 (Ga.

       Lender and attorney were properly granted summary judgment against a home buyer’s breach of contract, fraud, and conspiracy claims, as: (1) there was no evidence of a written purchase agreement for the home and the land it was placed on; and (2) a simple reading of the contract by the buyer would have protected against any alleged misrepresentations; moreover, to the extent that the home buyer’s claim of a conspiracy depended upon the viability of the fraud and breach of contract claims, it also failed.

       Trial court correctly considered matters outside a buyer’s request for quotation (RFQ) to determine the intended final obligations of the buyer and a seller under their agreement because the evidence supported the trial court’s finding that the parties’ actual agreement was not contained in any one document, such as the RFQ, since the RFQ anticipated that necessary terms such as material specifications, quantities, pricing information, and delivery dates would be supplied as part of the bidding and ordering process; because before, during, and after accepting the seller’s bid, the buyer was aware of the seller’s overseas supply chain and did not object to the seller’s stated reliance on a promised three-month forecast to obtain material, the trial court did not err in construing the written terms of the contract in light of that understanding and thereby denying the buyer cover damages for items exceeding the usage data provided to the seller.

      In a case in which a steel company signed a purchase order from a general contractor after it had rejected the terms of the purchase order and had submitted a counter-offer to the general contractor, a district court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the general contractor, correctly concluded that the record evidence disclosed no material fact in dispute; no reasonable jury could find that the general contractor and the steel company agreed to terms of a steel supply contract for the construction project.

       In a cottonseed buyer’s suit for breach of contract against a cottonseed seller, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the seller as no mutuality as to the contract terms existed since the buyer never obtained credit approval. Further, the buyer’s reliance on the purported promise was unreasonable as a matter of law; thus, promissory estoppel did not apply as the buyer never received credit approval, which was an essential element of the cottonseed business.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-207ol11">
       A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-207ol12">
       The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:

     </ol>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-207ol2a">

       Notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this title.

       Where the purchase order from a general contractor contained terms at variance with the initial proposal from the subcontractor, and following receipt of the purchase order, the subcontractor lodged no objection to its terms, but proceeded to manufacture the parts ordered and sent a supervisor to the job site, the trial court did not err in finding that the purchase order (including the plans and specs), rather than the proposal, constituted the contract between the parties.

       A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-210ol12">
       Except as otherwise provided in Code Section 11-9-406, unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on the other party by the contract, or impair materially the other party’s chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor’s due performance of the assignor’s entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-210ol13">
       The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller’s interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer’s chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) of this Code section unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-210ol14">
       Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of “the contract” is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor’s performance.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-210ol15">
       An assignment of “the contract” or of “all my rights under the contract” or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by the assignee to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-210ol16">
       The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his or her rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Code Section 11-2-609).

Plaintiff’s subrogation receipts clearly constituted sufficient evidence of a legal assignment of the implied warranty claim. Kraft Reinsurance Ir., Ltd. v. Pallets Acquisitions, LLC, 845 F.

      <p>
       Trial court could not have properly granted summary judgment against a general contractor by reason of its apparent acquiescence in a subcontractor’s breach of the subcontract by reason of its assignment because the contractor testified that it had a substantial interest in maintaining the subcontractor as the performer of the subcontract under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-210ol11" target="_self">11-2-210(1)</a></cite>, and that it looked for, but was unable to retain, any other asphalt provider besides the assignee; the subcontractor could not prevail on summary judgment in the wake of its repudiation of the subcontract, including the provision not to delegate performance.

       While delivery of property is not essential to passage of title to grantee, such delivery usually accompanies a transfer of title and absence of delivery calls for explanation. Failure to deliver property sold, when unexplained, is a badge of fraud, and a circumstance tending, when taken in connection with other circumstances, to show that title did not pass. Wallis v. Bellah, <cite class="ga_app_court">59 Ga. App. 633</cite>, <cite class="app_court">1 S.E.2d 773</cite> (1939) (decided under former Code 1933, § 96-107).

      Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.

       Mere fact that another name appears as the owner of a motor vehicle

       Decisive test in determining whether language used is mere expression of opinion or warranty, is whether it purported to state fact upon which it may fairly be presumed seller expected buyer to rely, and upon which buyer would ordinarily rely. If language used is of that character, fact of reliance on part of buyer and presumption of intent on part of seller which the law would raise in such case would operate to create warranty. Bell v.

       A warranty may be express or implied; it is the former when created by the apt and explicit statements of the seller; it is the latter when the law derives it by implication or inference from the nature of the transaction or the relative situation or circumstances of the parties. North Ga. Ready Mix Concrete Co. v. L &amp; L Constr., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">235 Ga. App. 68</cite>, <cite class="app_court">508 S.E.2d 722</cite> (1998).

       Trial court erred in denying a corporation’s motion for summary judgment on an individual’s claim for breach of an express warranty when the individual’s three-wheeled motorized scooter tipped over while the individual was operating the scooter in the individual’s yard as the individual failed to present any evidence that the scooter was generally unsuitable for use on non-paved and sloped surfaces and, therefore, the individual had not identified any evidence that the scooter did not conform to a salesperson’s description.

       Contract for the sale of a used pickup truck contained a purported waiver of any express warranties; further, the alleged misrepresentations on which the buyer sought to rely, that the truck “was in good condition” and was “a good running truck with no problems,” were mere statements of opinion or commendation of the goods. However, the buyer’s claim for revocation of acceptance was for the jury. Villalobos v. Atlanta Motorsports Sales, LLC, <cite class="ga_app_court">355 Ga.

       Implied warranty is a guaranty against loss only from latent defects. The law of implied warranty will not avail against patent defects, nor against latent defects which are either disclosed or are discoverable by exercise of caution on part of purchaser. Where property is brought under an implied warranty that it is reasonably suited to the use intended, an acceptance by the purchaser waives all defects discovered by the purchaser, or which by exercise of ordinary care and prudence, the purchaser might have discovered before delivery.

       The law imposes upon vendee the duty of exercising caution in detecting defects, and hence it is a well-established rule that where defect is patent, or could have been ascertained by exercise of diligence, there can be no recovery upon ground of an implied warranty and in all such cases the doctrine of caveat emptor applies; but in cases of latent defects, the existence of which cannot be ascertained by an examination of the property, the law protects a purchaser by imposing upon vendor an implied warranty, whenever the defect is of such a nature as to render article sold unsuited to use intended, and in cases of latent defects, therefore, the doctrine of caveat venditor applies.

       Because the product defect must exist at the time of sale or lease for an action under warranty to be valid, plaintiff could not recover for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability since plaintiff failed to show that defendant manufacturer was responsible for the truck’s brake failure.

       Trial court erred in entering summary judgment for a manufacturer on the owners’ breach of the implied warranty of merchantability claim as there were triable issues as to the driveability of a car at the time of its delivery where an owner brought the vehicle to the dealership approximately one month after the owner picked it up and had driven only 1,923 miles, and, among other things, there was a recurrant problem with the coolant lamp.

       Defendant’s compliance with plaintiff’s specifications did not eliminate the defendant’s duty to supply merchantable pallets; as there were genuine issues of material fact regarding plaintiff’s claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, summary judgment was inappropriate. Plaintiff’s expert testimony indicated that many pallet manufacturers were aware of mold issues caused by surface moisture on green heat-treated wood and, as a result, were drying pallets used for export, however, neither the pallet manufacturing standards nor the heat-treatment standards required any specific moisture content; this conflicting evidence raised a question of fact as to whether pallets with high moisture content were defective and unfit for shipping products overseas.

       It was undisputed that the defendant knew the plaintiff would be using the heat-treated pallets to ship products overseas and it was similarly undisputed that plaintiff specifically requested certain heat-treated pallets and that the pallets supplied by the defendant met these specifications; however, it was also undisputed that the plaintiff did not specify any particular moisture content for the pallets the plaintiff ordered. There was conflicting evidence in the record as to whether the plaintiff requested green or raw wood or whether the defendant decided unilaterally to use green wood; accordingly, as there was a question of fact as to whether the plaintiff relied on the defendant’s skill and judgment to supply it with pallets with appropriate moisture content for shipping products overseas in freight containers and whether the defendant failed to do so, summary judgment was inappropriate on the implied warranties claim.

       Under warranty provisions of Uniform Commercial Code where a product is sold which is to be installed by consumer, written instructions that accompany it create implied warranty that it will be fit for ordinary purpose for which it is used and will be safely operable when installed in accordance with such directions. Reddick v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 295 F. Supp. 243 (S.D. Ga. 1968).

       If a manufacturer furnishes instructions as to manner in which product is to be used, consumer is entitled to think that so used it will not injure the consumer and there is implied warranty that goods are fit for that particular use.

       Subject to subsection (3) of this Code section, to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that “There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.”

       A disclaimer of liability for breach of warranty by a tobacco seed manufacturer, which
   stated that liability would be limited to the purchase price, was unconscionable and would not be enforced; an absence of liability on the part of the manufacturer would leave farmers with no recourse for a loss caused by a crop failure, and the allocation of risk for ineffective seeds is better shouldered by the manufacturer than the consumer.

       If defects or discrepancies in article purchased are patent, such as might have been discovered by exercise of ordinary care and prudence, then acceptance by purchaser, in the absence of fraud, will operate as an absolute waiver on the purchaser’s part even of a claim for damages growing out of an implied warranty, but such mere acceptance will not prevent the purchaser from making a claim for damages arising out of an express warranty.

       O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-316ol12" target="_self">11-2-316(2)</a></cite> requires that, to exclude or modify an implied warranty of fitness, the actual warranty disclaimer language itself be conspicuous. That requirement is not satisfied if the disclaimer provision contains only general introductory language which is conspicuous. Leland Indus., Inc. v. Suntek Indus., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">184 Ga. App. 635</cite>, <cite class="app_court">362 S.E.2d 441</cite> (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Warranty disclaimer language was “conspicuous” where it appeared in capital letters, in a separate paragraph on the front of an invoice, and in a type style which was otherwise employed on the form only with regard to language relating to the limitation of remedies. Apex Supply Co. v. Benbow Indus., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">189 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">376 S.E.2d 694</cite> (1988).

       Implied warranty provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) did not apply to a settlement between a supplier and a customer because the primary purpose of the settlement was not a sale of goods, but was to resolve a dispute about whether the customer was obligated to purchase any goods and whether the goods were merchantable. Alternatively, under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-316ol13c" target="_self">11-2-316(3)(c)</a></cite>, the parties had excluded the UCC’s implied warranties based upon the parties course of conduct.

       A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling. In sales by auction the auctioneer shall be considered agent of both parties so far as to dispense with any further memorandum in writing than his own entries.

       Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer’s announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder’s retraction does not revive any previous bid.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Each provision of this article with regard to the rights, obligations, and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers, or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-401ol11">
       Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (Code Section 11-2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this title. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the article on secured transactions (Article 9 of this title), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-401ol12">
       Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his or her performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading:
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-401ol2a">
       If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him or her to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-401ol2b">
       If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods:
     </p>
     <p>
      If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he or she delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.
     </p>
     <p>
      A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a “sale.”

       The plaintiffs obtained all the rights to an automobile originally held by the defendant when they purchased the automobile from the dealer to whom it had been entrusted. However, after returning the car to the dealer in hopes this would enable plaintiffs to obtain a proper certificate of title, the plaintiffs eventually agreed to give up their claim to the automobile in exchange for the dealer’s promise to order them a new and different automobile. This subsequent agreement with the dealer revoked any right or title the plaintiffs had to the automobile in question and revested title back to the original owner, the defendant. Walker v.

    Power to transfer; good faith purchase of goods; “entrusting.”
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-403ol11">
       A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though:
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-403ol2a">
       The transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser; or
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-403ol2b">
       The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; or
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-403ol2c">
       It was agreed that the transaction was to be a “cash sale”; or
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-403ol2d">
       The delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Entrusting” includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor’s disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the articles on secured transactions (Article 9 of this title), bulk transfers (Article 6 of this title), and documents of title (Article 7 of this title).

       Delivery of automobiles by plaintiff, under contract of sale, to one known by plaintiff to be a dealer in used automobiles in Georgia, without taking any security therefor, and with whom plaintiff had done business in a similar manner many times before, constituted such evidence of right to sell plaintiff’s automobiles as according to custom of trade or common understanding of the world usually accompanies authority to dispose of them; plaintiff gave to dealer possession of the automobiles under external indicia of ownership, and dealer’s subsequent sale to defendant divested plaintiff of title.

       The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are nonconforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs:
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-501ol2a">
       When the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-501ol2b">
       If the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, when goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-501ol2c">
       When the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within 12 months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within 12 months or the next normal harvest season after contracting whichever is longer.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this Code section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.

       Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer’s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time, and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this article, and in particular:
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-503ol2a">
       Tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-503ol2b">
       Unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Where the case is within Code Section 11-2-504 respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) of this Code section and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this Code section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved:
     </p>
     <p>
      Tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer’s right to possession of the goods; but
     </p>
     <p>
      Tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and except as otherwise provided in Article 9 of this title receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer’s rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents:
     </p>
     <p>
      He or she shall tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of Code Section 11-2-323); and
     </p>
     <p>
      Tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection.

       Manufacturer did not breach its express warranty as the manufacturer addressed each defect in a vehicle as it arose, most repairs were made within days, and the only extended delay was the result of the buyer’s decision to postpone bringing the vehicle into the repair facility.

       Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3) of this Code section, where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. When the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-513ol12">
       Expenses of inspection must be borne by the buyer but may be recovered from the seller if the goods do not conform and are rejected.

       Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this article on C.I.F. contracts (subsection (3) of Code Section 11-2-321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods before payment of the price when the contract provides:
      </li>

      A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this Code section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract.

       A buyer who has attempted to reject rather than to accept goods may nonetheless accept them by virtue of buyer’s post-rejection conduct with respect to them. Likewise, a buyer who purports to revoke acceptance of goods may be found to have reaccepted them if, after such revocation, buyer performs acts which are inconsistent with the seller’s ownership of the goods. Griffith v. Stovall Tire &amp; Marine, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">174 Ga. App. 137</cite>, <cite class="app_court">329 S.E.2d 234</cite> (1985).

       A buyer who has attempted to reject rather than to accept goods may nonetheless accept them by virtue of buyer’s post-rejection conduct with respect to them.

       Manufacturer did not breach its express warranty as the manufacturer addressed each defect in a vehicle as it arose, most repairs were made within days, and the only extended delay was the result of the buyer’s decision to postpone bringing the vehicle into the repair facility.

       The question of reasonableness of notice is ordinarily a factual one, although summary adjudication is appropriate if the uncontroverted facts establish that a plaintiff is not entitled to recover. International Multifoods Corp. v. Nat'l Egg Prods., <cite class="ga_app_court">202 Ga. App. 263</cite>, <cite class="app_court">414 S.E.2d 253</cite> (1991), modified, No. A91A1281 (Ga. Ct.

       Where there was a material fact question as to whether a purchaser gave the manufacturer reasonable notice of defective goods, summary adjudication was precluded. Great W. Press, Inc. v.

       Whether purchaser acted unreasonably in not notifying seller, a defunct company, that it was dissatisfied that seller would not be providing the support services allegedly agreed upon was properly a question for the jury, and summary judgment on the basis of lack of notice was improperly granted to the seller.

       Because the purchaser of an automobile continued to drive the vehicle, pay taxes on it, and insure it after the purchaser complained of defects, these post-revocation acts constituted exercises in ownership by the purchaser that were inconsistent with the seller’s ownership; the buyer’s attempted revocation was ineffective under O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-606ol11c" target="_self">11-2-606(1)(c)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-608ol11b" target="_self">11-2-608(1)(b)</a></cite>.

       In a consumer’s suit against a car dealer for revocation of acceptance, regarding the sale of a used car which the dealer’s salesman falsely represented had not been in a wreck, it was not error for the trial court to grant a directed verdict to the dealer because, while there was evidence that the consumer attempted to revoke the acceptance and the dealer refused, the consumer subsequently acted inconsistently with the dealer’s ownership by continuing to possess the car and by installing a sunroof in it.

       Absolute refusal by one party to perform executory contract containing mutual obligations, prior to date or dates fixed for performance, if such repudiation goes to whole contract, amounts to tender of breach of contract; and if accepted as such by opposite party to contract, constitutes an anticipatory breach, and injured party may at that party’s election sue and recover entire damages at once.

       An “installment contract” is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause “each delivery is a separate contract” or its equivalent.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-612ol12">
       The buyer may reject any installment which is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (3) of this Code section and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.

       Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.

      <p>
       The Uniform Commercial Code does not require proof of impossibility of performance but merely that of impracticability, which term must be interpreted as commercial impracticability. To that extent the Uniform Commercial Code makes contract less binding on parties by widening grounds for which a seller may be relieved of the seller’s obligation. Swift Textiles, Inc. v. Lawson, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 799</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 167</cite> (1975).

        Standard by which impracticability should be judged

      <p>
       Severe shortage of raw materials or supplies due to contingency such as war, embargo, local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown or major sources of supply, or the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or altogether prevents seller from securing supplies necessary to performance, is within the contemplation of O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-615" target="_self">11-2-615</a></cite>.

       Mere unexpected difficulty or unforeseen expense encountered by seller

      </p>
      <p>
       Difficulty, inconvenience, or unusual cost in performing, though it may make performance hardship, does not excuse a party from performance of an absolute, unqualified undertaking to do a thing that is possible and lawful. Swift Textiles, Inc. v. Lawson, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 799</cite>, <cite class="app_court">219 S.E.2d 167</cite> (1975).

       Trial court did not err in awarding summary judgment to the State Medical Education Board, making a student liable for both the amount of the scholarship received and attorney’s fees, as: (1) estoppels were unfavored under Georgia law; (2) the student came forward with no more than hearsay to support a claim that oral misrepresentations of fact were made regarding said scholarship; (3) the contract was not rescinded by either party; (4) no mutual mistake of fact was found; and (5) any impossibility in performing the contract was personal to the student.

       An affirmative provision in contract that seller agrees to pay stipulated damages upon occurrence of an event making performance impossible necessarily implies that a breach of contract under those conditions is conceded, and places upon seller a greater obligation than might otherwise exist.

       Question of fact may arise

       Under the conditions stated in Code Section 11-2-703 on seller’s remedies, the seller may resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of this article (Code Section 11-2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer’s breach.

       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this Code section or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place, and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c02s11-2-706ol13">

      <li id="t11c02s11-2-706ol2c">

      A purchaser who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the seller fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this Code section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A person in the position of a seller (Code Section 11-2-707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security interest, as hereinafter defined (subsection (3) of Code Section 11-2-711).

       Subject to subsection (2) of this Code section and to the provisions of this article with respect to proof of market price (Code Section 11-2-723), the measure of damages for nonacceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in this article (Code Section 11-2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer’s breach.
      </li>

       If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) of this Code section is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this article (Code Section 11-2-710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.

       The evidence clearly established a breach of an agreement to buy/sell electronic circuit boards and a resulting right to damages even though the amount of damages was arrived at by use of a complex and confusing mathematical methodology which did not produce exact arithmetical accuracy.

      <p>
       In order for seller to establish that seller is a “lost volume dealer,” seller must prove that even though the repudiated contract goods were later resold by the seller, the sale to the third party would have been made regardless of the buyer’s breach so that the seller would have realized two profits from two sales.

       Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates or the buyer rightfully rejects or justifiably revokes acceptance then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to the whole if the breach goes to the whole contract (Code Section 11-2-612), the buyer may cancel and whether or not he has done so may in addition to recovering so much of the price as has been paid:

      On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance a buyer has a security interest in goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, care, and custody and may hold such goods and resell them in like manner as an aggrieved seller (Code Section 11-2-706).

       In a suit brought by a buyer after an oral contract for the sale of a horse fell through, damages were not speculative; there was evidence that the seller had an offer of $50,000 for the horse on the same day that the seller agreed to sell the horse to the buyer for $35,000, and that the horse was eventually sold to another party for over $200,000.

       Though a subcontractor successfully proved a breach of contract claim against a supplier, the damages award in the amount of $160,000 was reversed on appeal as the subcontractor failed to present any evidence of anticipated expenses due to the loss of a construction project arising from the breach, and therefore the subcontractor’s proof of lost profits was insufficient as a matter of law and required a new trial; further, because the damages award was reversed, the appellate court also reversed the award of attorney fees to the subcontractor since the award of attorney fees was contingent upon the damages award on the breach of contract claim.

       While some cases hold that repair costs are a sufficient measure of damages, there are others holding the opposite view; the basic rule is that the measure of damages for breach of warranty is to be determined by O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c02s11-2-714" target="_self">11-2-714</a></cite>. Whether repair costs can satisfy the proof requirement depends entirely on the sufficiency and reliability of the evidence presented in the context of the individual case. Fried Group, Inc. v. Sundance Tractor &amp; Mower, 218 Bankr. 247 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1998).

       Under Fed. R. Evid. 701, the buyer of motor home could give lay testimony as to market value of motor home following repairs performed by the seller and the buyer’s market value opinion was relevant because the seller conceded that the market for the type of motor home at issue was extremely individualized and the buyers represented half of the entire market for that type of motor home during the year that it was purchased; the sales contract was relevant evidence on the issue of damages because the purchase price of the motor home was evidence of its value as warranted.

       The agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this article, as by limiting the buyer’s remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of nonconforming goods or parts; and

      Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.

      <p>
       Creditor’s unqualified right to require the debtor to repurchase equipment during or at termination of a purported lease, coupled with a letter agreement that was intended to insure the return of the creditor’s investment and a return on the investment of a certain percentage indicated that the lease was a disguised security agreement.

       Claimant’s unwritten agreement with an individual concerning a vehicle was not a lease because the claimant offered no evidence that the individual had the right to voluntarily terminate the individual’s payment obligation under the agreement, i.e., to pay less than the full amount of consideration under the lease, or that the individual could purchase the vehicle only after paying additional consideration.

      A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this article, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of the lessee or who is a guest in the lessee’s home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. This Code section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons. The operation of this Code section may not be excluded, modified, or limited, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this Code section.

      A transfer of “the lease” or of “all my rights under the lease”, or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights, and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default.

     <p>
      In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous.

       The 2001 amendment,
      </b>
      effective July 1, 2001, in subsection (1), inserted “Code” at the beginning and substituted “paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of Code Section 11-9-109” for “Code Section 11-9-102(1)(b)”; in subsection (2), substituted “subsection (3) of this Code section and in Code Section 11-9-407,” for “subsections (3) and (4),” and “subsection (4) of this Code section” for “subsection (5)”; deleted subsection (3), which read: “A provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits the creation or enforcement of a security interest in an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor’s residual interest in the goods, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual transfer by the lessee of the lessee’s right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the provision or an actual delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the provision.
   Neither the granting nor the enforcement of a security interest in (i) the lessor’s interest under the lease contract or (ii) the lessor’s residual interest in the goods is a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the lessee within the purview of subsection (5) unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual delegation of a material performance of the lessor.
   For purposes of this subsection: (a) a party’s ‘performance’ includes its rights as well as its duties; and (b) a party creating or enforcing (or seeking to create or enforce) a security interest that the lease contract prohibits or makes an event of default has the burden of proving that such a transfer does not involve an actual delegation of a material performance.”; redesignated former subsections (4) through (8) as present subsections (3) through (7), respectively; substituted “subsection (4) of this Code section” for “subsection (5)” at the end of subsection (3); in subsection (4), substituted “subsection (3) of this Code section and to Code Section 11-9-407” for “subsections (3) and (4) ” in the introductory language, in paragraph (4)(a), substituted “If” for “if” at the beginning and substituted “subsection (2) of Code Section 11-2A-501” for “Code Section 11-2A-501(2)” at the end, and, in paragraph (4)(b), substituted “If paragraph (a) of this subsection” for “if paragraph (a)” at the beginning, and substituted “determining the extent of liability for damages under this paragraph” for “clause (b)(2)” in the last sentence.

     </ol>
     <p>
      Under this article a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.
     </p>
     <p>
      This article does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:
     </p>
     <p>
      The lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within ten days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor’s interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The interest of a lessor of fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:
     </p>
     <p>
      The fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures the lease contract is enforceable; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee’s right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding subsection (4)(a) but otherwise subject to subsections (4) and (5), the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may(i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the agreement and this article, or(ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them.A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the article on secured transactions (Article 9 of this title).

       Damages based on market rent (Code Section 11-2A-519 or 11-2A-528) are determined according to the rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times specified in Code Sections 11-2A-519 and 11-2A-528.

       If a lessor fails to deliver the goods in conformity to the lease contract (Code Section 11-2A-509) or repudiates the lease contract (Code Section 11-2A-402), or a lessee rightfully rejects the goods (Code Section 11-2A-509) or justifiably revokes acceptance of the goods (Code Section 11-2A-517), then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (Code Section 11-2A-510), the lessor is in default under the lease contract and the lessee may:

      If a lessor has breached a warranty, whether express or implied, the lessee may recover damages (Code Section 11-2A-519(4)).

      On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance, a lessee has a security interest in goods in the lessee’s possession or control for any rent and security that has been paid and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody and may hold those goods and dispose of them in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, subject to Code Section 11-2A-527(5).

     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of Code Section 11-2A-407, a lessee, on notifying the lessor of the lessee’s intention to do so, may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any default under the lease contract from any part of the rent still due under the same lease contract.

      Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by the nonconformity. Revocation is not effective until the lessee notifies the lessor.

      <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1a">
       Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this Code section, “negotiable instrument” means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:
       <ol>
        <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1a1">
         Is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;

        <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1a2">
         Is payable on demand or at a definite time; and

        <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1a3">
         Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain:

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1b">
       “Instrument” means a negotiable instrument.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1c">
       An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section, except paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, and otherwise falls within the definition of “check” in subsection (f) of this Code section is a negotiable instrument and a check.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1d">
       A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this article.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c03s11-3-104ol1e">
       An instrument is a “note” if it is a promise and is a “draft” if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both “note” and “draft,” a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.

       Appellate court erred in reversing a trial court’s grant of summary judgment pursuant to O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.09.html#t09c11s9-11-56" target="_blank">9-11-56</a></cite> to an auto dealership in a conversion action against a bank, which alleged that the bank deliberately cashed a check after the dealership had placed a stop payment on the check.
   The law applicable to conversion of personal property applied to instruments pursuant to O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-420ol1a" target="_self">11-3-420(a)</a></cite>, and checks were one form of instrument included in this provision, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-104ol1c" target="_self">11-3-104(c)</a></cite>, (f); therefore, the dealership was not required to establish the existence of specific dollars or coins in order to recover for the conversion of its check and the full value of the intangible rights identified with that check.

       Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank because the bank acted properly in refusing to honor the cashier’s check since the funds were the property of the payee and were within the control of the bank at the time the bank received the garnishment order; thus, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.18.html#t18c04s18-4-4" target="_blank">18-4-4</a></cite> required that the bank pay those funds into the court in the garnishment action and not to the payee.

       Except as provided in this Code section, for the purposes of subsection (a) of Code Section 11-3-104, a promise or order is unconditional unless it states (i) an express condition to payment; (ii) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing; or (iii) that rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing. A reference to another writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.

       A promise or order is not made conditional (i) by a reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration; or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.

       If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of subsection (a) of Code Section 11-3-104. If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.

      <li id="t11c03s11-3-106ol1d">
       If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of subsection (a) of Code Section 11-3-104; but, if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Purpose of former Code 1933, § 14-403, which required endorsement of the entire instrument or the unpaid residue, was
   to prevent payee or payees from varying or enlarging contract initially made by maker of instrument. When a maker executed a negotiable instrument payable to one payee or more, jointly, the maker subjected to one lawsuit, and if the payee in instrument transferred it to two or more endorsees severally, such endorsement subjected maker to two or more suits to which the maker had not been liable at time executed instrument. Hodson v. Scoggins, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 44</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 715</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-403).

      <p>
       Possession of a negotiable instrument is presumptive evidence of title, but it is not conclusive.
   One in possession of personal property is presumed to be the owner until the contrary appears, and the burden of rebutting the presumption is upon the party claiming adversely to the one in possession.

       Under this section, whenever two or more persons sign as maker they are jointly and severally liable unless instrument in its own language specifies obligation differently, e.g., “we jointly promise” or “we promise severally.” Ghitter v. Edge, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga. App. 750</cite>, <cite class="app_court">165 S.E.2d 598</cite> (1968) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-118" target="_self">11-3-118</a></cite>).

      <p>
       A promissory note signed by two or more persons as makers, and containing the words, “I, we, or either of us promise to pay,” imports joint and several liability of makers. This comports with this section. Powell v. Mobley, <cite class="ga_court">166 Ga. 163</cite>, <cite class="app_court">142 S.E. 678</cite> (1928) (decided under former Ga. L. 1924, p. 126, § 17(7)).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where negotiable instrument contains words “we promise to pay” and is signed by three parties, absent specific provision to contrary, comakers are jointly and severally liable under provisions of this section. Simpson v. Wages, <cite class="ga_app_court">119 Ga. App. 324</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E.2d 213</cite> (1969) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-118" target="_self">11-3-118</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where promissory note is signed by three persons as comakers and contains language “we promise to pay,” liability is joint and several, and an action against two comakers is sustainable even though one comaker is dismissed as a party defendant. Hubert v. Lawson, <cite class="ga_app_court">146 Ga.

      Subject to applicable law regarding exclusion of proof of contemporaneous or previous agreements, the obligation of a party to an instrument to pay the instrument may be modified, supplemented, or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if the instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement. To the extent an obligation is modified, supplemented, or nullified by an agreement under this Code section, the agreement is a defense to the obligation.

       Although it was true that the obligation of a party to an instrument could be modified, the bank was entitled to summary judgment on its breach of contract claim, which alleged that the obligors executed two promissory notes, that the notes were later in default, that the obligors did not have a defense, especially since the obligors did not show how modification agreements, to which the obligors were not parties, relieved them of their obligations on the notes.

      In an action for breach of an obligation for which a third person is answerable over pursuant to this article or Article 4 of this title, the defendant may give the third person written notice of the litigation, and the person notified may then give similar notice to any other person who is answerable over. If the notice states that (i) the person notified may come in and defend; and (ii) failure to do so will bind the person notified in an action later brought by the person giving the notice as to any determination of fact common to the two litigations, the person notified is so bound unless after seasonable receipt of the notice the person notified does come in and defend.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Purpose of former Code 1933, § 14-403, requiring endorsement of the entire instrument or the residue, was to prevent payee or payees from varying or enlarging contract initially made by maker of instrument. When a maker executed a negotiable instrument payable to one payee or more, jointly, the maker was subjected to one lawsuit, and if the payee in instrument transferred it to two or more endorsees severally, such endorsement subjected maker to two or more suits to which the maker had not been liable at time executed instrument. Hodson v. Scoggins, <cite class="ga_app_court">102 Ga. App. 44</cite>, <cite class="app_court">115 S.E.2d 715</cite> (1960) (decided under former Code 1933, §§ 14-403 and 14-412).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Idea of endorsement or negotiation is not only excluded while note remains in hands of payee, but such is equally true prior to time it reaches payee’s hands by delivery. Davis v. National City Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 194</cite>, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 639</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 191</cite> (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-401).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there are but two original parties to promissory note, maker and payee, so long as note remains in hands of payee, the idea of endorsement is excluded. Willoughby v. Newman, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga. App. 377</cite>, <cite class="app_court">167 S.E. 783</cite> (1933) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-401).

       </b>

      <p>
       To be holder in due course of note payable to named payee or order requires payee’s endorsement. Fourth Nat'l Bank v. Lattimore, <cite class="ga_court">168 Ga. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">148 S.E. 396</cite> (1929) (decided under former Ga. L. 1924, p. 126, § 52).

       Instrument payable to order can only be negotiated by endorsement. Roswell Bank v. Citizens &amp; S. De Kalb Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">104 Ga. App. 291</cite>, <cite class="app_court">121 S.E.2d 706</cite> (1961) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-401).

      <p>
       Legal title to note, payable to order, does not pass to transferee for consideration of love and affection only, except by endorsement on instrument or on paper attached to it. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="ga_app_court">35 Ga. App. 39</cite>, <cite class="app_court">131 S.E. 922</cite> (1926) (decided under former Ga. L. 1924, p. 126, § 31).

      </h4>
      <p>
       In suit by transferee of negotiable instrument, written endorsement thereon, bearing as signature only corporate name of payee, not accompanied by name of agent by whom affixed nor by corporate seal, is, nevertheless, sufficient proof of transfer, unless endorsement be specifically denied on oath. Sheffield v. Johnson County Sav. Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">2 Ga. App. 221</cite>, <cite class="app_court">58 S.E. 386</cite> (1907) (decided under former Code 1895, § 3705).
      </p>
      <p>
       An endorsement alone never constitutes negotiation,
      
      and an attempt to negotiate note payable to order by endorsement of holder is incomplete, so that if stopped there, without delivery, there is no negotiation and title remains in holder. Evans v. Luce, <cite class="ga_court">190 Ga. 403</cite>, <cite class="app_court">9 S.E.2d 646</cite> (1940) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-401).

       Where instrument is payable to order of three payees and it specifically states that interest of third payee is to be $1,000.00, endorsee of such third payee may maintain action for interest in the instrument without endorsement of other two payees and without joining them as parties.

       Where record shows that promissory note sued on was transferred for value by payee to plaintiff, but fails to show any endorsement, there was a transfer but no “negotiation” of instrument, and such transfer without endorsement does not preclude defendant from pleading, as against plaintiff transferee, any defenses which defendant could have set up against payee.

       Mere delivery of a check by the check’s issuer to a payee of that check is not a transfer of an interest in property of the issuer other than as to the paper or other object on which the check was written because the delivery of the check, apart from any intrinsic value the check might have, does not reduce the issuer’s net worth or give the holder of the check any claim on the property of the issuer other than the right to enforce the check. But if a check, whenever delivered, is honored when the issuer is a debtor in bankruptcy, the payment of the check is, in the parlance of <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 549</cite>, a “transfer of property of the estate.” In re Georgetown Square II LLC, No. 11-86382, 2012 Bankr.

       “Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the instrument; (ii) restricting payment of the instrument; or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on the instrument; but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than indorsement. For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.

     <p>
      Reacquisition of an instrument occurs if it is transferred to a former holder, by negotiation or otherwise. A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel indorsements made after the reacquirer first became a holder of the instrument. If the cancellation causes the instrument to be payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, the reacquirer may negotiate the instrument. An indorser whose indorsement is canceled is discharged, and the discharge is effective against any subsequent holder.

       There is no compelling reason that a bank cannot be a holder or holder in due course of an instrument drawn on it if it meets all qualifications of the status, e.g., by taking instrument from transferor who is a holder in due course. FDIC v. West, <cite class="ga_court">244 Ga. 396</cite>, <cite class="app_court">260 S.E.2d 89</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-301" target="_self">11-3-301</a></cite>).

       Bank that acquired a promissory note and security deed that a Chapter 13 debtor executed before the debtor declared bankruptcy, transferred the note and deed to a loan trust, and acted as the trustee for the benefit of entities that purchased interests in the trust, had standing to request relief under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 362(d)</cite> to foreclose on the debtor’s property; the bankruptcy court allowed the bank to proceed with a foreclosure sale and to record a deed of sale it obtained when it bought the debtor’s property at the foreclosure sale because the debtor did not have equity in the property and did not have a reasonable prospect of proposing a viable Chapter 13 plan. The bank was a “holder” of the note and was entitled under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-301" target="_self">11-3-301</a></cite> to enforce the note.

       A holder in due course is one who, in good faith and for value, has taken an instrument that is complete and regular upon its face before it was due, and without notice of any previous dishonor, and who, at the time of taking, had no notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating it.

       No matter what the deposit agreement was initially, when bank did in fact credit deposit to its customer, and thereafter permit customer to withdraw funds before collection, the bank became a holder for value of the check as to amount withdrawn, so as to be able to enforce payment against drawer thereof.

       Bank was not a holder in due course of a certificate of deposit owned by company A which was indorsed to the bank as security for a loan to company B by an officer who had authority to indorse but not to pledge certificate as security so company B had no interest in the certificate and the bank did not take for value.

       Where a bank had credited a seller’s account with the amount of a buyer’s check and subsequently, the buyer issued a stop-payment order on the check but, by the time the bank received notification, the seller had spent almost all of the buyer’s check, the bank was not merely a holder of the buyer’s check but was a holder in due course.

       Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank and a credit union, on claims of conversion, civil conspiracy and for attorney fees and punitive damages, as: (1) no probative evidence existed that the buyer received delivery of the check, and thus, it never became a holder of the instrument at issue or entitled to enforce it; (2) no evidence was presented that the bank and credit union acted in concert against the buyer; (3) no evidence of misconduct or bad faith on the part of the bank or the credit union was presented; but, the trial court properly found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the bank and the credit union were holders in due course.

       “Fraud in the factum” is the only type fraud available under the Uniform Commercial Code as a defense against a holder in due course; mere allegations of misrepresentation are not sufficient to prove “fraud in the factum” to withstand plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.

       The only type of fraud assertable against a holder in due course under former paragraph (2)(c) is fraud in factum. Fraud in the inducement, which does not go to the essence of the agreement but merely induces the party to enter the agreement, would not have the same effect because it would render the instrument merely voidable and capable of transfer.

       Production of instrument entitles a holder to recover on it unless defendant establishes a defense, and burden of proving that one is a holder in due course does not shift to holder until it is shown that a defense exists.

       Under Uniform Commercial Code, defense of fraud in inducement cannot be asserted against a holder in due course. There is no protection against a defense of fraud in the factum, however. FDIC v. Willis, 497 F. Supp. 272 (S.D. Ga. 1980) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-302).

      <p>
       Under defense of fraud in the factum, the fraud which defendants attempt to show must be in the factum, or within the loan instrument itself. Such a defense fails, however, where essential terms of note are correct; fact that the instrument incorrectly reflects that loan was secured does not affect validity of underlying transaction.

       Defense of setoff is available but it was apparently intention of legislature to limit this defense to demands in some way connected with debt sued on, or transaction out of which it sprang. Srochi v. Kamensky, <cite class="ga_app_court">118 Ga.

       Where consideration for contract is so expressed as to make it one of its conditions, a party may not under guise of inquiring into its consideration alter terms of instrument by parol, but parol evidence is otherwise admissible to show lack or failure of consideration. The same is true on defense of conditional delivery. Kelley v. Carson, <cite class="ga_app_court">120 Ga.

       In an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of and authority to make each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under subsection (a) of Code Section 11-3-402.

If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.

       Trial court did not err by finding a guarantor personally liable on a promissory note because the trial court correctly found that the language of the promissory note, the unconditional guaranty, and the modification to the promissory note were unambiguous, and since the documents’ provisions were clear, the trial court’s proper role was to apply the terms as written; in the guaranty, the guarantor expressly waived all notices or defenses to which the guarantor could be entitled under the guaranty, to the extent permitted by law, and because the guarantor failed to assert any defense based upon an alleged incompetency to enter into a contract at the time the guarantor executed the guaranty, and because the guarantor failed to show that the guaranty’s broad waiver of defenses was prohibited by statute or public policy, the guarantor was bound thereby.

       Payment of promissory note to supposed transferee, holding by virtue of forged endorsement, will not protect maker or one who has assumed the debt against payment to true owner; and, consequently, in a suit by such alleged transferee to enforce liability against such parties, assumer may utilize defense that alleged transfer by payee was not genuine.

If that proof is made, Code Section 11-3-308 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.

Delivery of a declaration of loss is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration. If a claim is asserted in compliance with this subsection, the following rules apply:

       One who places name on back of promissory note, without more, for purpose of lending credit to the instrument for accommodation of maker, is nevertheless an endorser in the legal sense of the word, and is not a surety, unless as between the original parties one is shown to be a surety by agreement of the parties thereto.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The General Assembly intended that both the name of the organization and the office (official capacity) of an authorized individual be included before a signature would be deemed “a signature made in a representative capacity.” In other words, former subsection (3) of this section relieves the signer of an instrument from the burden of establishing that one signed it in a representative capacity, as required by former subsection (2), but only when the conditions stated therein are met. Yeomans v. Coleman, Meadows, Pate Drug Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">167 Ga. App. 646</cite>, <cite class="app_court">307 S.E.2d 121</cite> (1983) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-403" target="_self">11-3-403</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       One signing in a representative capacity need not follow any set formal mode of signing
      
      but may use words such as to indicate that one is signing in a representative capacity and negative personal liability. Duke v. Williams, <cite class="ga_app_court">92 Ga. App. 151</cite>, <cite class="app_court">88 S.E.2d 289</cite> (1955) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-220).
      </p>
      <p>
       One signing document without showing
    signature “in a representative capacity” is personally obligated
      
      under this section. Barnett v. Leasing Int'l, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 452</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-403" target="_self">11-3-403</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent proof that signature was made as representative, this section applies, resulting in personal liability. Casey v. Carrollton Ford Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">152 Ga. App. 105</cite>, <cite class="app_court">262 S.E.2d 255</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-403" target="_self">11-3-403</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       An authorized representative was not personally liable
      
      where the representative signed a check imprinted with the name of the represented business even though the instrument did not indicate on its face that it was being signed in a representative capacity. Peterson v. Holtrachem, <cite class="ga_app_court">239 Ga. App. 838</cite>, <cite class="app_court">521 S.E.2d 648</cite> (1999), cert. denied, No. S00C0094, 2000 Ga. LEXIS 153 (Ga. Jan. 28, 2000).

       An authorized signatory on a corporate account can not be held personally liable for corporate checks returned for insufficient funds. Helmer v. Rumarson Techs., Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">245 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">538 S.E.2d 504</cite> (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action following the default of a promissory note, the trial court properly granted the defendant summary judgment because the defendant signed the promissory note solely in a representative capacity of a limited liability company and was not personally liable and the plaintiff knew that the defendant had not signed in a personal capacity.

       Where defendant admits to executing instrument but contends that it was done in corporate capacity at request of plaintiff’s representative or agent, defendant is still personally obligated if instrument neither names person represented nor shows that representative signed in representative capacity. Barnett v. Leasing Int'l, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">151 Ga. App. 715</cite>, <cite class="app_court">261 S.E.2d 452</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-403" target="_self">11-3-403</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       One who executes note in own name with nothing on face of note showing agency cannot introduce parol evidence to show that one executed it for a principal, or that payee knew that one intended to execute it as agent, and under this section, one is personally obligated if instrument neither names person represented nor shows that representative signed in representative capacity. Stone v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">159 Ga. App. 812</cite>, <cite class="app_court">285 S.E.2d 207</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-403" target="_self">11-3-403</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the contract itself was ambiguous as to the capacity in which defendant signed because defendant’s signature appeared above the name of the allegedly represented entity but failed to reflect defendant’s office or otherwise show that defendant was signing in a representative capacity, the jury could conclude that defendant signed the contract in an individual capacity, and not as an agent, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for directed verdict. Griffin v. Associated Payphone, <cite class="ga_app_court">244 Ga. App. 183</cite>, <cite class="app_court">534 S.E.2d 540</cite> (2000).

       Former paragraph (1) does not establish separate and distinct estoppel by negligence defense for payor who pays instrument over forged endorsement. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">266 S.E.2d 254</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-404" target="_self">11-3-404</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       When one who has paid an instrument asserts that another is estopped by negligence from denying that unauthorized signature on it operates as own, payor personally must have paid in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards of one’s business. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">266 S.E.2d 254</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-404" target="_self">11-3-404</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       When payor seeks to estop or preclude another from asserting that payor’s signature on an instrument is forged under former paragraph (1) of this section and the basis for asserting this estoppel or preclusion is neglect of one whose “signature” appears, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-406" target="_self">11-3-406</a></cite> controls.

      <p>
       The word “precluded” has been held to be synonymous with “estoppel,”
      
      and not to include ratification or adoption of the instrument or signature thereon unless these involve also the elements of estoppel. To create such an estoppel, there must be actual injury or damage. Beeland v. Clark, <cite class="ga_app_court">47 Ga.

       In suit instituted by person claiming to be owner and holder of promissory note for purpose of recovering thereon against maker and another alleged to have assumed the debt, it is permissible for the latter to inquire into plaintiff’s title to the note, if necessary either for that one’s protection or to let in any valid defense which that individual may seek to make.

       Bank was properly granted summary judgment in a suit filed against it by a law firm for negligently accepting stolen checks and for conversion with regards to blank-endorsed cashier’s checks, as such were bearer paper transferable by possession alone; however, because a fact issue remained as to whether it acted in good faith in accepting forged checks, it could not be a holder in due course, and summary judgment on that issue was improper.

       If an impostor, by use of the mails or otherwise, induces the issuer of an instrument to issue the instrument to the impostor, or to a person acting in concert with the impostor, by impersonating the payee of the instrument or a person authorized to act for the payee, an indorsement of the instrument by any person in the name of the payee is effective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.

      <p>
       When one who has paid an instrument asserts that another is estopped by negligence from denying that unauthorized signature on it operates as one’s own, payor personally must have paid in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards of one’s business. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact question remained whether a bank violated the reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing when it violated known commercial banking practices by accepting checks made payable to a law firm into a thief’s personal account, where the bank also serviced the firm’s business accounts and therefore knew that the firm normally placed a restrictive endorsement stamp on checks made payable to it, as the bank was on heightened notice of the irregularity of the endorsements and therefore could be held to have dealt with the firm unfairly by not making inquiry into the legitimacy of those endorsements. Gerber &amp; Gerber, P.C. v. Regions Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">266 Ga. App. 8</cite>, <cite class="app_court">596 S.E.2d 174</cite> (2004).

        Questions of fact. —

      </h4>
      <p>
       Reasonable commercial standards and whether they were met under circumstances are initially questions of fact. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">266 S.E.2d 254</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-406" target="_self">11-3-406</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appropriate inquiry
      
      is whether a reasonable man in accordance with reasonable commercial standards would be put on notice of some impropriety appearing either from form of the instrument and its endorsements or from knowledge of facts outside the instrument itself. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">266 S.E.2d 254</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-406" target="_self">11-3-406</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to inquire into validity of endorsements
      
      does not preclude bank from asserting defense of commercial reasonableness as a matter of law. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank v. Port Term. &amp; Warehousing Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">153 Ga. App. 735</cite>, <cite class="app_court">266 S.E.2d 254</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-406" target="_self">11-3-406</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank accepting check with “a patently irregular endorsement”
      
      does not comply with reasonable commercial standards, and fact that depositor of check is a customer of the bank does not absolve bank of its duty to inquire. National Bank v. Refrigerated Transp. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">147 Ga. App. 240</cite>, <cite class="app_court">248 S.E.2d 496</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-406" target="_self">11-3-406</a></cite>).

       That is material which might become material, and any alteration which may in any event alter rights, duties, or obligations of person sought to be charged, is material in the legal sense.

      <p>
       If legal import and effect of instrument is in fact changed, it does not matter how trivial the change may be, or whether it may be beneficial or detrimental to party sought to be charged on contract, as where it changes evidence or mode of proof.

      </p>
      <p>
       That alteration was fraudulently made for purpose of causing actual injury, or that it did bring about injury, is not the test of materiality. It is equally unimportant whether alteration was beneficial or injurious to party whom it is sought to charge on the instrument. The sole question is whether rights of promissor have been materially affected; whether effect of instrument is the same as when signed. Cook v. Parks, <cite class="ga_app_court">46 Ga.

       While under former Code 1933, § 14-1707, the certification of a check, even if procured by drawer, amounts to assignment of the fund in the sense that it operates to withdraw it from deposit account of drawer, the mere fact of such certification by the drawer does not, before delivery of the check, operate as an assignment of the fund to payee.

       Under this section, holder or payee of check which has not been accepted or certified has no right of action against drawee bank based upon its failure or refusal to honor the check, even though at time check was presented for payment, bank had sufficient funds of drawer on deposit to pay it.

       Promissory note is unconditional contract of maker
      
      to pay payee according to tenor of instrument. Tatum v. Bank of Cumming, <cite class="ga_app_court">135 Ga. App. 675</cite>, <cite class="app_court">218 S.E.2d 677</cite> (1975); Curtis v.

       The sale of a note, although it may provide the seller with sufficient funds to cover the debt, does not discharge the maker’s obligation to pay the note according to its terms. First State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. McIver, 893 F.2d 301 (11th Cir. 1990) (decided under former Code Section 11-3-413).

       A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to the instrument. Except as provided in Code Section 11-3-605, the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.

       If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if (i) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied; (ii) the other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding; (iii) the other party cannot be served with process; or (iv) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.

      </p>
      <p>
       Two primary factors are usually found to indicate accommodation party status: (1) the accommodation party received no benefits from the proceeds of the instrument, and (2) the signature was needed by the maker to acquire the loan. Other factors which have been required to be shown in order to determine whether a party can claim this status include the purpose in signing the instrument, and the intent of the parties to the instrument. Bank S. v. Jones, <cite class="ga_app_court">185 Ga. App. 125</cite>, <cite class="app_court">364 S.E.2d 281</cite> (1987) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-415" target="_self">11-3-415</a></cite>).

      <p>
       The concept of an “accommodation party” as it is recognized in Georgia is a broad one, and there is no requirement that the accommodated party personally be an actual party to the note. Scott v. Citizens Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 618</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 633</cite> (1988) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-415" target="_self">11-3-415</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a note may have been signed by defendant in the capacity of the maker thereof and that a bank’s president personally did not sign the note in any capacity whatsoever would not preclude a finding that, under the existing circumstances, defendant, in signing the note, was in actuality signing it as an accommodation party for the bank’s president. Scott v. Citizens Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">188 Ga. App. 618</cite>, <cite class="app_court">373 S.E.2d 633</cite> (1988) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-415" target="_self">11-3-415</a></cite>).

       One signing name to instrument for purpose of lending credit to that of maker becomes an accommodation party, regardless of whether that person receives any compensation for so acting or does so gratuitously.

       One who lends name to another party to a negotiable instrument in any capacity is an accommodation party regardless of whether that person received any compensation for so acting or did so gratuitously, and one cannot legally assert lack of consideration for accommodation since value received by principal debtor is consideration for which accommodation party bargained.

       The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by (i) the issuer or acceptor of the instrument; or (ii) a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c03s11-3-420ol1b">
       In an action under subsection (a) of this Code section, the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff’s interest in the instrument.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c03s11-3-420ol1c">
       A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.

       Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank and a credit union, on claims of conversion, civil conspiracy and for attorney fees and punitive damages, as: (1) no probative evidence existed that the buyer received delivery of the check, and thus, it never became a holder of the instrument at issue or entitled to enforce it; (2) no evidence was presented that the bank and credit union acted in concert against the buyer; (3) no evidence of misconduct or bad faith on the part of the bank or the credit union was presented; but, the trial court properly found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the bank and the credit union were holders in due course and whether the check bore evidence of forgery or alteration so as to call into question its authenticity.

       On cross-motions for summary judgment in a Fair Labor Standards Act case filed by plaintiff Mexican national agricultural laborers against defendant employers that included a claim for conversion of certain “reimbursement” checks in that the employers directed the laborers to endorse and return the checks, and the employers argued that it was entitled to the returned checks due to the employers paying for bus fares and subsistence and additional transportation expenses in cash, and also argued that the checks were blank, the court agreed with the employers that because the checks were blank, under O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-104ol1c" target="_self">11-3-104(c)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-420ol1a" target="_self">11-3-420(a)</a></cite>, they were valueless, so there would be no damage from converting the checks.

       Where endorsements are irregular enough on their face to raise question as to their validity; and when checks are offered for deposit into account of one not payee, bank has duty to inquire to ascertain authority of depositor to endorse and deposit payee’s checks, and cannot escape its duty of inquiry by relying on word of its customer, the depositor, nor does fact that bank could proceed against its customer under warranty provisions of O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-417" target="_self">11-3-417</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-207" target="_self">11-4-207</a></cite> absolve it of obligation of inquiry.

       According to rules of common law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, the endorser of a promissory note is entitled to have the same duly presented for payment, and of a failure or refusal to pay the endorser is entitled to notice; and a failure of the holder to present for payment, or to give notice of nonpayment, discharges the endorser from liability.

       The law does not require that notice of presentment and dishonor of a negotiable instrument be given to an endorser in order to charge the endorser with liability, where the endorser already has knowledge of such matters. The law does not require a useless thing. McCarroll v. First Inv. Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">109 Ga.

       To bind the endorser as such on notes endorsed after maturity, there had to be a presentment for payment and notice of dishonor upon nonpayment, and before endorsee could proceed against endorser on the instrument, petition must have set forth compliance with these prerequisites to liability.

       Retention of check for unreasonable time without cashing and without indicating refusal to accept it as an accord and satisfaction constitutes acceptance. Studstill v. AMOCO, <cite class="ga_app_court">126 Ga. App. 722</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E.2d 538</cite> (1972), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 305</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E.2d 847</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-503" target="_self">11-3-503</a></cite>).

        Retention of check for unreasonable period may work accord and satisfaction. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       If one intends to accept a check as payment of demand, it should be promptly presented for payment, usually within a 30-day period. Where, in absence of circumstances suggesting a contrary state of facts, the check, although not cashed, is kept for a period greatly in excess of this time, such retention may of itself cause the debtor to rely on theory that his offer (accord) has been accepted (satisfaction), in which case the creditor no longer has a right of action for any excess payment due. Studstill v. AMOCO, <cite class="ga_app_court">126 Ga. App. 722</cite>, <cite class="app_court">191 S.E.2d 538</cite> (1972), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">230 Ga. 305</cite>, <cite class="app_court">196 S.E.2d 847</cite> (1973) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-503" target="_self">11-3-503</a></cite>).

       Mere retention of stale check, with knowledge on part of debtor that creditor refused to accept it in full satisfaction of unliquidated liability, will not operate as an accord and satisfaction.

      <p>
       There is no conflict between application of O.C.G.A. Ch. 7, T. 10 and holding that commercial paper chapter of Uniform Commercial Code controls in cases based on negotiable instruments, since O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c03s11-3-601" target="_self">11-3-601</a></cite>, which provided for discharge of parties to negotiable instruments, in former subsection (2) provided for such use of O.C.G.A. § Ch. 7, T. 10. Import of that subsection was that in situations other than those listed in former subsection (1) of this section, the law providing for discharge of surety or guarantor of simple contract for payment of money applies equally to surety or guarantor of negotiable instruments. Consequently, an agreement (novation) which would discharge surety or guarantor of simple contract for payment of money will also discharge one who is guarantor or surety on negotiable instrument. Sewell v. Akins, <cite class="ga_app_court">147 Ga. App. 454</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 274</cite> (1978).

       Since Article 3 does not cover guaranties which are not ancillary to notes or other actionable negotiable instruments, Article 3 was not applicable to determine the effectiveness of an oral renunciation of a guaranty by a bank’s loan officer, after one note had been fully satisfied by the debtor and before subsequent notes were executed which would otherwise have been covered by a future advances clause in the guaranty.

       If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension discharges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the extent the indorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.

       If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse. The loss suffered by the indorser or accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse.

The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent (i) the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse of the party asserting discharge; or (ii) the reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the interest.

       If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of any party who is jointly and severally liable with respect to the secured obligation is discharged to the extent the impairment causes the party asserting discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to pay, taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had not occurred. If the party asserting discharge is an accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection (e) of this Code section, the party is deemed to have a right to contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a right to reimbursement. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.

       Under subsection (e) or (f) of this Code section, impairing value of an interest in collateral includes (i) failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral; (ii) release of collateral without substitution of collateral of equal value; (iii) failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of collateral owed, under Article 9 of this title or other law, to a debtor or surety or other person secondarily liable; or (iv) failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of collateral.

       Where a promissory note provided that the bank could “release any security . . . without affecting [defendants’] obligation to pay the loan,” it was apparent that defendants consented in advance to an impairment of collateral by the bank. Consequently, they were estopped to assert the defense of impairment of collateral. H &amp; H Operations, Inc. v. West Ga. Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">181 Ga. App. 766</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 633</cite> (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       A commercial loan officer’s testimony that accommodated party had sold some business fixtures and brought the proceeds of the sale to the bank, which applied them toward her business loans, was insufficient to show an “impairment of collateral” within the meaning of subsection (1)(b) (now (e)). Richards v. First Union Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">199 Ga. App. 636</cite>, <cite class="app_court">405 S.E.2d 705</cite> (1991), cert. denied, No. S91C1145, 1991 Ga. LEXIS 725 (Ga.

      <p>
       Even if the obligors were accommodation parties who signed two promissory notes that went into default, a point they argued without factual support, the modification agreements signed by the other people did not release them from their obligations under the notes as the obligors did not show that the agreement to extend the due date of the instrument at issue caused loss to them with respect to the right of recourse or that the value of the collateral had been impaired. Reece v. Chestatee State Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">260 Ga. App. 136</cite>, <cite class="app_court">579 S.E.2d 11</cite> (2003), cert. denied, No. S03C1021, 2003 Ga. LEXIS 561 (Ga.

       The fact that a bank did not verify signatures on forged checks following a change in its rule on verification was sufficient to raise a factual issue as to its exercise of ordinary care, and, even if it showed conclusively that it complied with local industry standards, that simply shifted the burden to the bank’s customer to produce rebuttal evidence that the bank did not exercise ordinary care.

      <p>
       The trial court properly upheld an agreement between a customer and a bank under which the bank could not be charged with liability for negligence because the customer had not notified the bank of disputed checks within 30 days; under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-103ol1a" target="_self">11-4-103(a)</a></cite>, parties by agreement could change the 60-day notice period allowed for in O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-406ol1f" target="_self">11-4-406(f)</a></cite>, and such an agreement was controlling unless it was manifestly unreasonable, which was not the case here, and shortening the time period did not excuse the bank from its duty of ordinary care or disclaim the bank’s liability for negligence in the future inasmuch as the notice period started over again each time the bank sent a new statement to the customer. Freese v. Regions Bank, N.A., <cite class="ga_app_court">284 Ga. App. 717</cite>, <cite class="app_court">644 S.E.2d 549</cite> (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1190, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 691 (Ga.

       There was no issue of fact as to whether a check received by a bank was returned to the Federal Reserve Bank by the midnight deadline of June 19, although the Federal Reserve stamped the check received as of June 22, because there was no evidence to contradict a bank officer’s deposition that the check was timely returned. The bank had no control over when the Federal Reserve processed the check. Whooping Creek Constr., LLC v. Bartow County Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">310 Ga.

       In light of the similarity of the issues dealt with under the provisions, certain decisions under former Code 1933, § 14-502 are included in the annotations for this section.

       Primary purpose of O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-201" target="_self">11-4-201</a></cite>
      
      seems to be to avoid litigation over question of status of collecting banks, i.e., as owners or agents for collection, and to make any settlements given by them to owner of instruments provisional until they have received final settlement for the instruments. By making settlement provisional, this section causes risk of loss to continue in owner of item rather than in agent bank. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">138 S.E.2d 442</cite> (1964).
      </p>

       The collecting bank is merely an agent of the drawer
      
      of a draft. Wallace v. Harrison, <cite class="ga_app_court">166 Ga. App. 461</cite>, <cite class="app_court">304 S.E.2d 487</cite> (1983).

        Bank’s right to sue drawer in own name in spite of presumption of agency. —

      </h4>
      <p>
       Fact that presumption of plaintiff-depositary bank’s agency of payee-depositor for collection purposes continues even after credit given depositor has been withdrawn does not negative right of bank to bring action in its own name against defendant-drawer. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">138 S.E.2d 442</cite> (1964).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff bank is unable to obtain settlement, either final or provisional, from payor bank by reason of stop payment order of defendant-drawer, it becomes holder in due course (all pertinent requirements having been met) with a security interest in the item which enables it to enforce payment against drawer, with right of charge-back against its depositor’s account in event that judgment cannot be obtained against drawer. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">138 S.E.2d 442</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where check is deposited and credited to depositor’s account and depositor is allowed to draw against it, the bank is presumed to be holder in due course in spite of express conditions in deposit contract making bank a mere agent for collection, where there are other facts; namely, that draft was endorsed in blank and bank thereafter paid checks drawn by endorser against such deposit, making bank at least a pledgee, if not absolute owner of the draft, and placing it on same footing as a purchaser. Southern Fruit Distribs., Inc. v. Citizens' Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 832</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E. 261</cite> (1932); Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-502).

        Effect of collection agreement. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Collection agreement is simply a device for bank and depositor to determine respective rights between themselves, not such a contract as will conclusively and in all events determine status of paper so far as third parties are concerned. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-502).
      </p>
      <p>
       While deposit to credit of depositor under collection agreement gives rise to presumption of agency relationship rather than debtor-creditor relationship, and while, between parties themselves, the bank may always charge back uncollected check against its depositor whether it has advanced funds thereon or not, nevertheless, the presumption of agency relationship, so far as third parties are concerned, holds only so long as no contrary agreement between bank and depositor is shown. Proof that bank did in fact not only credit fund to depositor but allowed the depositor to draw against that credit is, according to better rule, conclusive evidence of a contrary agreement. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-502).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a bank credited depositors’ accounts and permitted them to withdraw funds prior to their collection, and they did in fact withdraw funds, the bank became a holder in due course as to the amounts withdrawn so as to be able to enforce payment of the amounts. Howell v. Bank of Newman (In re Summit Fin. Servs., Inc.), 240 Bankr. 105 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1999).

       If credit given for several items received at one time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or applied in part, the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents, or the proceeds of either.

       Receipt by a collecting bank of a final settlement for an item is a realization on its security interest in the item, accompanying documents, and proceeds. So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or possession or control of the accompanying documents for purposes other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to Article 9 of this title, but:

      For purposes of determining its status as a holder in due course, a bank has given value to the extent it has a security interest in an item, if the bank otherwise complies with the requirements of Code Section 11-3-302 on what constitutes a holder in due course.

      <p>
       Where check is deposited and credited to depositor’s account and depositor is allowed to draw against it, the bank is presumed to be holder in due course in spite of express conditions in deposit contract making bank a mere agent for collection, where there are other facts, namely, that draft was endorsed in blank and bank thereafter paid checks drawn by endorser against such deposit, making bank at least a pledgee, if not absolute owner of the draft, and placing it on same footing as a purchaser. Southern Fruit Distribs., Inc. v. Citizens' Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">44 Ga. App. 832</cite>, <cite class="app_court">163 S.E. 261</cite> (1932) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-502); Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what the deposit agreement was initially, when bank did in fact credit deposit to its customer, and thereafter permitted customer to withdraw fund before collection, the bank became a holder for value of the check as to amount withdrawn, so as to be able to enforce payment against drawer thereof. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-502).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Collection agreement is simply a device for bank and depositor to determine respective rights between themselves, not such a contract as will conclusively and in all events determine status of paper so far as third parties are concerned. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-502).
      </p>
      <p>
       While deposit to credit of depositor under collection agreement gives rise to presumption of agency relationship rather than debtor-creditor relationship, and while, between parties themselves, the bank may always charge back uncollected check against its depositor whether it has advanced funds thereon or not, nevertheless, the presumption of agency relationship, so far as third parties are concerned, holds only so long as no contrary agreement between bank and depositor is shown. Proof that bank did in fact not only credit fund to depositor but allowed depositor to draw against that credit is, according to better rule, conclusive evidence of a contrary agreement. Pike v. First Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">99 Ga. App. 598</cite>, <cite class="app_court">109 S.E.2d 620</cite> (1959) (decided under former Code 1933, § 14-502).

       If a collecting bank has made provisional settlement with its customer for an item and fails by reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a bank, or otherwise to receive settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer’s account, or obtain refund from its customer, whether or not it is able to return the item, if by its midnight deadline or within a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends notification of the facts. If the return or notice is delayed beyond the bank’s midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts, the bank may revoke the settlement, charge back the credit, or obtain refund from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay.

        Right to charge back credit. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A bank has the right to revoke the credit it has extended when it is unable to collect the check upon which it has extended the provisional credit. The fact that the customer has used a portion of the credit extended does not affect the bank’s right to charge back the credit, even though the bank was negligent in its representation that the deposited check was “good.” However, the elements of estoppel prevent the bank from obtaining a refund of the amount credited to the account. First Ga. Bank v. Webster, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga. App. 307</cite>, <cite class="app_court">308 S.E.2d 579</cite> (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff bank is unable to obtain settlement, either final or provisional, from payor bank by reason of stop payment order of defendant-drawer, it becomes a holder in due course (all pertinent requirements having been met) with a security interest in the item which enables it to enforce payment against drawer, with right of charge back against its depositor’s account in event that judgment cannot be obtained against drawer. Pazol v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">110 Ga. App. 319</cite>, <cite class="app_court">138 S.E.2d 442</cite> (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank’s deposit agreement with the bank’s customer was not unreasonable and permitted the bank to charge back to the customer’s account the amount of a check upon the check’s return from another bank as fraudulent, although the bank had provided provisional funds that the customer had withdrawn or paid out. Vadde v. Bank of Am., <cite class="ga_app_court">301 Ga. App. 475</cite>, <cite class="app_court">687 S.E.2d 880</cite> (2009), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">562 U.S. 894</cite>, <cite class="s_court">131 S. Ct. 298</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">178 L.

       Where bank exercises charge back rights granted by debiting customer’s account on notice of dishonor for exact amount of checks in issue and thereby made itself whole, it will not be permitted to also recover amount of checks from drawer.

       A customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than one person may stop payment of any item drawn on the customer’s account or close the account by an order to the bank describing the item or account with reasonable certainty received at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in Code Section 11-4-303. If the signature of more than one person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c04s11-4-403ol1b">
       A stop-payment order is effective for six months, but it lapses after 14 calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in writing within that period. A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional six-month periods by a writing given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c04s11-4-403ol1c">
       The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer. The loss from payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under Code Section 11-4-402.

       The rationale for allowing the drawer more time to report an unauthorized indorsement than an unauthorized signature is that there is little excuse for a customer not detecting an alteration of the customer’s own check or a forgery of the customer’s own signature. However, the customer does not know the signatures of indorsers and may be delayed in learning that indorsements are forged. Where both are present, the customer should discover and report the unauthorized payment within the shorter time period. Decatur Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Litsky, <cite class="ga_app_court">207 Ga. App. 752</cite>, <cite class="app_court">429 S.E.2d 300</cite> (1993).

       There are circumstances wherein notice referred to in former Code 1933, § 13-2044, need not be given, and it is only when a bank has in good faith paid a forged check that it is entitled to such notice.

       There are two circumstances where notice requirement of former Code 1933, § 13-2044, is not a prerequisite to recovery: (1) where bank has not paid forged or raised check out of depositor’s account in good faith, and (2) where depositor for other sufficient reason is relieved from giving such notice.

       To require of depositor the notice referred to in former Code 1933, § 13-2044, check paid must be a forgery as contemplated by criminal statutes, but where bank paid money from depositor’s account because it believed person obtaining funds was authorized by depositor to do so, § 13-2044 is not applicable, and no notice is required to hold the bank liable.

      A bank that takes a documentary draft for collection shall present or send the draft and accompanying documents for presentment and, upon learning that the draft has not been paid or accepted in due course, shall seasonably notify its customer of the fact even though it may have discounted or bought the draft or extended credit available for withdrawal as of right.

    Presentment of “on arrival” drafts.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a draft or the relevant instructions require presentment “on arrival,” “when goods arrive,” or the like, the collecting bank need not present until in its judgment a reasonable time for arrival of the goods has expired. Refusal to pay or accept because the goods have not arrived is not dishonor; the bank must notify its transferor of the refusal but need not present the draft again until it is instructed to do so or learns of the arrival of the goods.

     <p>
      Unless otherwise instructed and except as provided in Article 5 of this title, a bank presenting a documentary draft:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c04s11-4-503ol11">
       Must deliver the documents to the drawee on acceptance of the draft if it is payable more than three days after presentment; otherwise, only on payment; and
      </li>
      <li id="t11c04s11-4-503ol12">
       Upon dishonor, either in the case of presentment for acceptance or presentment for payment, may seek and follow instructions from any referee in case of need designated in the draft or, if the presenting bank does not choose to utilize the referee’s services, it must use diligence and good faith to ascertain the reason for dishonor, must notify its transferor of the dishonor and of the results of its effort to ascertain the reasons therefor, and must request instructions.
       <p>
        However, the presenting bank is under no obligation with respect to goods represented by the documents except to follow any reasonable instructions seasonably received; it has a right to reimbursement for any expense incurred in following instructions and to prepayment of or indemnity for those expenses.

    Security procedure.

     </h3>
     <p>
      “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication.A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.

A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer.

      If a receiving bank fails to accept a payment order that it is obliged by express agreement to accept, the bank is liable for breach of the agreement to the extent provided in the agreement or in this article, but does not otherwise have any duty to accept a payment order or, before acceptance, to take any action, or refrain from taking action, with respect to the order except as provided in this article or by express agreement. Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in Code Section 11-4A-209, and liability is limited to that provided in this article.A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this article or by express agreement.

If the originator’s bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator’s bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator.An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts.

      If the sender of a payment order that is erroneously executed as stated in Code Section 11-4A-303 receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was executed or that the sender’s account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care to determine, on the basis of information available to the sender, that the order was erroneously executed and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the notification from the bank was received by the sender. If the sender fails to perform that duty, the bank is not obliged to pay interest on any amount refundable to the sender under Code Section 11-4A-402(d) for the period before the bank learns of the execution error. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the sender on account of a failure by the sender to perform the duty stated in this section.

       If, under this article, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined (i) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank, or (ii) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c4As11-4A-506ol1b">
       If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (a), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable Federal Funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable.The applicable Federal Funds rate is the average of the Federal Funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The Federal Funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.

       may serve a purpose similar to that of a former Article 5 confirmation by providing the beneficiary with an additional source of payment; however, it involves different parties and creates different rights and obligations and, clearly, a silent confirmation is not a former Article 5 confirmation and falls outside the operation of the UCC.

       If an issuer wrongfully dishonors or repudiates its obligation to pay money under a letter of credit before presentation, the beneficiary, successor, or nominated person presenting on its own behalf may recover from the issuer the amount that is the subject of the dishonor or repudiation. If the issuer’s obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money the claimant may obtain specific performance or at the claimant’s election recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer. In either case the claimant may also recover incidental damages but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant’s recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document.

       If issuer wrongfully dishonors draft or demand for payment under credit letter, person entitled to honor may recover from issuer the face amount of the draft or demand together with incidental damages. Incidental damages include all commercially reasonable expenditures. The test of commercial reasonableness is a practical one, requiring primarily honesty and good faith in attempting to minimize damages. What is commercially reasonable is to be determined from all the facts and circumstances of each case, and must be judged in light of one viewing situation at time problem was presented.

     Inasmuch as transfers in violation of this article are ineffective to pass title of goods from transferor to transferee, remedies available to original seller are those seller would have had against transferor, and contract action on open account against transferee is not such a remedy. American Express Co. v. Bomar Shoe Co., <cite class="ga_app_court">125 Ga. App. 408</cite>, <cite class="app_court">187 S.E.2d 922</cite> (1972).

     The Bulk Transfer Act, O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c06s11-6-101" target="_self">11-6-101</a></cite> et seq., preserves a creditor’s remedy against the goods, not against the transferee personally, and permits a creditor to pursue goods in the hands of a transferee as though they still belonged to the transferor. Consequently, this act does not authorize a direct action for negligence against the transferee of corporate stock. Brown Transp. Corp. v. Street, <cite class="ga_app_court">194 Ga.

     This article has no language which compels creditor of one who thereafter sells to another in bulk to look to latter for payment, whether or not as between debtor and debtor’s transferee there is an agreement that latter will pay the debt, where original seller has not agreed to substitute transferee in place of purchaser and is stranger to contract between the latter.

     Where the relationship of the creditor to the bulk transferor is multifaceted, the creditor may pursue common law and equitable remedies, if any, against the transferee without reliance on the bulk transfer law. Boss v. Bassett Furn. Indus. of N.C., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">249 Ga. 166</cite>, <cite class="app_court">288 S.E.2d 559</cite> (1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     There is nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code to indicate that the creditor of a bulk transferor may not proceed on any common law or equitable cause of action the creditor may have against the transferee, notwithstanding the bulk transfer law. On the contrary, the Uniform Commercial Code provides that unless displaced by particular provisions, the principles of law and equity, including fraud, etc., shall supplement its provisions. Boss v. Bassett Furn. Indus. of N.C., Inc., <cite class="ga_court">249 Ga. 166</cite>, <cite class="app_court">288 S.E.2d 559</cite> (1982).

       In a dispute over a storage facility’s storage of a customer’s seed, in which the facility sought to bind the customer to limitations printed on the reverse of the facility’s warehouse receipts, the trial court erred by concluding that evidence that the facility routinely mailed warehouse receipts to the facility’s customers was sufficient to bind the customer as a matter of law; because the customer denied receiving the receipts, the customer’s assent was a question for the jury.

       A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its failure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances. Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07s11-7-204ol1b">
       Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not liable. Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse’s liability for conversion to its own use. On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse’s liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse receipt. In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the goods.

      <li id="t11c07s11-7-209ol1a">
       A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse’s lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.

      <li id="t11c07s11-7-209ol1b">
       A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (a) of this Code section, such as for money advanced and interest. The security interest is governed by Article 9 of this title.

       A warehouse’s lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) of this Code section or a security interest under subsection (b) of this Code section is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good-faith purchaser for value would have been valid. However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:

       Except as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, a warehouse’s lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to insure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.

       A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier’s receipt of the goods for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carrier’s lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges are stated, a reasonable charge.

       A carrier’s lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07s11-7-308ol1b">
       Before any sale pursuant to this Code section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this Code section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but shall be retained by the carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this article.

       A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier’s lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier’s noncompliance with this Code section.
      </li>

       A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this Code section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier would have been bound to deliver the goods.

       Paramount title of “true owner” is not cut off by unauthorized bailment or issuance of documents of title, and the true owner may replevy them from warehouseman or from anyone else who has them. If warehouseman delivers the goods to true owner, the warehouseman is relieved from liability even to a good faith purchaser of negotiable receipts and, a fortiori, from liability to any other sort of receipt holder.

     <p>
      Unless a document of title was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a person that did not have power to dispose of them, a lien does not attach by virtue of any judicial process to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title is outstanding unless possession or control of the document is first surrendered to the bailee or the document’s negotiation is enjoined. The bailee may not be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to the bailee or to the court. A purchaser of the document for value without notice of the process or injunction takes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.

      If more than one person claims title to or possession of the goods, the bailee is excused from delivery until the bailee has a reasonable time to ascertain the validity of the adverse claims or to commence an action for interpleader. The bailee may assert an interpleader either in defending an action for nondelivery of the goods or by original action.

    Evidentiary rules concerning certificated securities.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The following rules apply in an action on a certificated security against the issuer:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c08s11-8-114ol11">
       Unless specifically denied in the pleadings, each signature on a security certificate or in a necessary indorsement is admitted.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c08s11-8-114ol12">
       If the effectiveness of a signature is put in issue, the burden of establishing effectiveness is on the party claiming under the signature, but the signature is presumed to be genuine or authorized.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c08s11-8-114ol13">
       If signatures on a security certificate are admitted or established, production of the certificate entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense or a defect going to the validity of the security.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c08s11-8-114ol14">
       If it is shown that a defense or defect exists, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the plaintiff or some person under whom the plaintiff claims is a person against whom the defense or defect cannot be asserted.

       Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a certificated security include terms stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by reference on the certificate to another instrument, indenture, or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, to the extent the terms referred to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate. A reference under this subsection does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the security, even if the certificate expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice. The terms of an uncertificated security include those stated in any instrument, indenture, or document or in a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is issued.

         A security other than one issued by a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, even though issued with a defect going to its validity, is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the particular defect unless the defect involves a violation of a constitutional provision. In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than one who takes by original issue.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c08s11-8-202ol1b2">
         Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.

      <li id="t11c08s11-8-202ol1c">
       Except as otherwise provided in Code Section 11-8-205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice.

      <li id="t11c08s11-8-202ol1d">
       All other defenses of the issuer of a security, including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a certificated security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken the certificated security without notice of the particular defense.

      <li id="t11c08s11-8-202ol1e">
       This Code section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security “when, as and if issued” or “when distributed” in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the subject of the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or distributed.

       If a security is held by a securities intermediary against whom an entitlement holder has a security entitlement with respect to the security, the issuer may not assert any defense that the issuer could not assert if the entitlement holder held the security directly.

       An indorsement may be in blank or special. An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer. A special indorsement specifies to whom a security is to be transferred or who has power to transfer it. A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.

       An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.

       If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied.

       Transfer of abandoned stock certificates. —
      
      If requested, the commissioner of revenue may, but is not required to, provide the issuing corporation or its transfer agent with a document signed by the commissioner authorizing the transfer of abandoned stock certificates to the commissioner pursuant to the Georgia Unclaimed Property Act, O.C.G.A. Art. 5, Ch. 12, T. 44, and such transfer document would satisfy the requirements of the UCC pertaining to the transfer of stock certificates. 1983 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 83-77 (decided under former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c08s11-8-401" target="_self">11-8-401</a></cite> prior to 1992 repeal).
      </p>
      <p>
       The implicit requirement of the Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act that stock certificates be delivered to the commissioner of revenue registered in the commissioner’s name takes precedence over the provisions of the UCC pertaining to a separate transfer document signed by an appropriate person. 1983 Op.

       If a security interest in a security is perfected at the date this Act takes effect, and the action by which the security interest was perfected would suffice to perfect a security interest under this Act, no further action is required to continue perfection. If a security interest in a security is perfected at the date this Act takes effect but the action by which the security interest was perfected would not suffice to perfect a security interest under this Act, the security interest remains perfected for a period of four months after the effective date and continues perfected thereafter if appropriate action to perfect under this Act is taken within that period. If a security interest is perfected at the date this Act takes effect and the security interest can be perfected by filing under this Act, a financing statement signed by the secured party instead of the debtor may be filed within that period to continue perfection or thereafter to perfect.

    <p>
     Concept and intention of this article is to provide method whereby all security interests can be perfected. In some instances, filing is required, and in others, possession of collateral is only means available or permitted whereby creditor can perfect security interest. In re Atlanta Times, Inc., 259 F. Supp. 820 (N.D. Ga. 1966), aff'd, 383 F.2d 606 (5th Cir. 1967).

      Conversion of property subject to security interest. —
     </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Where property is subject to security interest, exercise of dominion or control over property which is inconsistent with rights of secured party, constitutes, as to the secured party, conversion of the property; and there may be conversion by secured party where the party acts are in defiance of rights of others in the property. Trust Co. v. Associated Grocers Coop., <cite class="ga_app_court">152 Ga. App. 701</cite>, <cite class="app_court">263 S.E.2d 676</cite> (1979).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where a sale of collateral is, with respect to the secured party, a conversion of the collateral, there is a conversion on the part of the one who sells, as well as on the part of the one who purchases, and the purchaser may be liable regardless of intent, and regardless of the purchaser’s lack of actual knowledge of the rights of the secured party. Trust Co. v. Associated Grocers Coop., <cite class="ga_app_court">152 Ga. App. 701</cite>, <cite class="app_court">263 S.E.2d 676</cite> (1979).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where lease provisions retained title in the lessor
    
    and the leased machine was to be returned to the lessor at the termination of the lease with no residual interest therein to the lessee, the lease was not a security instrument and this article does not apply. Capital Assocs. v. Zabel, <cite class="ga_app_court">172 Ga. App. 19</cite>, <cite class="app_court">322 S.E.2d 67</cite> (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where there was no agreement or intent by either party that the lessee would purchase leased equipment, the fact that the contract obligated the lessee to pay taxes, insurance, and expenses of repairs, and allowed the lessor to retain the equipment after it was returned, did not make the contract a security agreement rather than a lease. City Food Mart, Inc. v. Bell Atl. Tricon Leasing Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">218 Ga. App. 57</cite>, <cite class="app_court">460 S.E.2d 525</cite> (1995), cert. denied, No. S95C1813, 1995 Ga.

     There is no Georgia law that requires the simultaneous transfer of an underlying promissory note with the transfer of the security interest.

       Under the promissory note, the debtors were consumers who were to pay money to the lender, and the debtor’s obligation to do so arose from a transaction involving property that was primarily for the debtors’ personal, family, or household purposes; the promissory note was a debt within the plain language of <cite class="us_code">15 U.S.C. § 1692</cite>a(5), and the law firm’s letter and enclosed documents were an attempt to collect that debt—the complaint sufficiently alleged that the notice was a communication related to the collection of a debt within the meaning of <cite class="us_code">15 U.S.C. § 1692</cite>e. Even if the firm intended the letter and documents to give notice of the foreclosure to the debtors, the letters also demanded payment on the underlying debt and the fact that the letter and documents related to the enforcement of a security interest did not prevent the letters from also relating to the collection of a debt within the meaning of § 1692e; the complaint contained enough factual content to allow a reasonable inference that the firm was a debt collector because the firm regularly attempted to collect debts.

      <p>
       Property listed in financing statements need not be specific but must only reasonably identify same, giving dated leases and amount of same, “secured by” equipment listed in leases and its location. Stephens v. Bank of Camilla, <cite class="ga_app_court">133 Ga. App. 210</cite>, <cite class="app_court">210 S.E.2d 358</cite> (1974), aff'd, <cite class="ga_court">234 Ga. 293</cite>, <cite class="app_court">216 S.E.2d 71</cite> (1975) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-110" target="_self">11-9-110</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Physical description in financing statement need not be sufficient in itself to identify the property. It is sufficient if description provides such key to identity of property as would enable a person of ordinary business prudence, upon inquiry, to discover actual identity of property described. Abney v. ITT Diversified Credit Corp. (In re Environmental Elec. Sys.), 11 Bankr. 965 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-110).
      </p>
      <p>
       Description of the collateral contained in the financing statement was insufficient because the description did not indicate that the collateral covered all assets or all personal property of the debtor, nor did the description meet the requirements under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-108" target="_self">11-9-108</a></cite> for a reasonable identification. If the description had been “all future receivables of the Debtor,” it would have met the requirements under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-108" target="_self">11-9-108</a></cite> by describing the collateral through category.

       Purchase money security agreements on consumer goods are not required to be filed, and purpose of description of collateral in such agreements is not to give notice, as a financing statement, but is to provide identification of collateral so as to avoid disputes over its identity. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 388</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 72</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-110" target="_self">11-9-110</a></cite>).

       Requirement that identification of collateral indicate type of collateral is applicable to financing statements, not security agreements. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v.

       Bankruptcy court found that: (1) the equipment in issue was incorrectly described in both the security agreement and the financing statement; and (2) the rights of the debtor, as a hypothetical lien creditor, were superior to the rights of the creditor.

       Whether record gives sufficient notice depends not only on language appearing in mortgage, but also upon what a person of ordinary business prudence would have ascertained from pursuing such lines of inquiry as data given in mortgage would naturally suggest to the reasonable person’s mind; and, additionally, any further information actually possessed by claimants at time of transaction, which would have led an ordinary man to believe that dealings were with mortgaged property, or would ordinarily have led the reasonable man to further inquiry, may be taken into consideration in determining whether they had notice of lien, or were legally chargeable with notice.

       Where a bank, based on its prior perfected security interest, sued a cattle-raiser for cattle in possession, the trial court correctly ruled that the Federal Security Act (7 U.S.C.A. § 1631), which controlled the transaction, preempted this article and properly awarded summary judgment to cattle-raiser.

      <p>
       Creditor-holder of a properly perfected UCC security interest in debtor’s freights did not take priority over holders of valid maritime liens. While freights fall within the literal terms of the definitions in former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-106" target="_self">11-9-106</a></cite>, their inclusion therein does not subject maritime lien claimants to UCC priority rules. First, former subsection (a) of this section excludes security interests arising under federal statutes from the ambit of the UCC; unlike former subsection (b). Its state law counterpart, former subsection (a) does not specifically subject federal liens to UCC priority provisions. Second, former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102" target="_self">11-9-102</a></cite> excludes non-consensual transactions from the UCC. Maritime liens by nature arise without intent or consent. Finally, maritime liens take priority over UCC security interests under pre-or post-UCC cases. McAllister Towing v. Ambassador Factors, (In re Topgallant Lines), 154 Bankr. 368 (S.D. Ga. 1993), aff'd, 20 F.3d 1175 (11th Cir. 1994) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-104" target="_self">11-9-104</a></cite>).

       Even though a debtor gave possession of a note and security deed and executed a transfer and assignment of the instruments to the creditor as collateral for a loan, the instruments never vested in the creditor and the transaction was not the creation or transfer of an interest in real estate under former subsection (h); thus, where the creditor did not comply with the notice requirement of former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-305ol12" target="_self">11-9-305(2)</a></cite>, the debtor was entitled to recover either damages for conversion of the collateral after default or damages prescribed by former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-507" target="_self">11-9-507</a></cite>.

       A financing statement merely gives notice of the existence of a security interest but in itself does not create a security interest, for which a security agreement is required. Amoco Oil Co. v. G. Sims &amp; Assocs., <cite class="ga_app_court">162 Ga.

       A financing statement cannot serve as a security agreement because it does not grant the creditor a security interest in the collateral and does not identify the obligation owed to the creditor.

       Purchase money security agreements on consumer goods are not required to be filed, and purpose of description of collateral in such agreements is not to give notice, as on a financing statement, but is to provide identification of collateral so as to avoid disputes over its identity. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 388</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 72</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-203" target="_self">11-9-203</a></cite>).

       Test of the sufficiency of a description is that the description do job assigned to it, that it make possible identification of thing described. Personal Thrift Plan of Perry, Inc. v. Georgia Power Co., <cite class="ga_court">242 Ga. 388</cite>, <cite class="app_court">249 S.E.2d 72</cite> (1978) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-203" target="_self">11-9-203</a></cite>).

      <p>
       Written security agreement satisfies this provision if it is signed by debtor and contains description of collateral. Additional requirement of description of collateral is necessary to solve the evidentiary problem of identifying collateral when secured party lacks possession of it. Barton v. Chemical Bank, 577 F.2d 1329 (5th Cir. 1978) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-203).

Thus, like the financing statement, the security agreement failed to place third parties on notice of a possible security interest in accounts receivable. Healthcorp, Inc. v.

These three elements were met and the creditor’s security interest in the debtor’s inventory and its proceeds had been properly attached. In re Shree Meldikrupa Inc., No. 15-4141 1-EJC, 2016 Bankr.

       After-acquired property was included under the part in a security agreement providing that a loan was secured by “all equipment, accessories and parts added or attached thereto,” and the failure of a lender to disclose in the agreement the ten-day limitation of former subsection (2) of this section on after-acquired property subject to the lender’s security interest violated a regulation of the Truth in Lending Act.

       Georgia’s Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code requires proper filing of a financing statement in order to perfect an interest in personal property. The creditor did not dispute that a financing statement indicating the creditor’s security interest in any of the debtor’s personal property had not been filed and, therefore, the creditor held an unperfected security interest in the debtor’s personal property, including the debtor’s inventory and its proceeds; thus, the creditor was not an entity with an interest in cash collateral within the meaning of <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 363</cite>.

       Where lease agreements with option to purchase specifically dated back to the time of delivery when debtor took possession, it was held that debtor acquired possession of three scrapers for purposes of subsection (4) at the time they were delivered by seller, rather than the time that debtor and seller entered into the lease agreements for the three scrapers, and because seller did not file its financing statement on two of the scrapers within 15 days of the time debtor took possession, as required by subsection (4), seller failed to timely perfect its purchase money security interest in these two scrapers, so bank’s prior security interest in equipment, including after-acquired property, had priority over seller’s purchase money security interest in these two scrapers pursuant to subsection (5)(a), but because it timely perfected its purchase money security interest in the third scraper, seller had priority over the bank pursuant to subsection (4).

        General rule. —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The general rule in Georgia is that personal property which is actually or constructively attached to real property is considered part of the realty so that an interest arises in it under real estate law. Wright v. C &amp; S Family Credit, Inc., 128 Bankr. 838 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1991) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).

        Nature of fixtures. —

      </h4>
      <p>
       Fixture is not a separate, exclusive classification of goods, but rather a unique category of property. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section clearly recognized that fixtures may be subject to two different types of security interest: a chattel interest and a real estate interest; and this recognition is in accord with dual nature of a fixture, a chattel which has become real property; indeed, existence of both chattel interest and real estate interest in fixtures gives rise to need for this former section which attempted to equitably resolve conflicts between these two interests. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).

       The former provisions of this section did not apply to creation of real estate interests in fixtures; that is a matter left to real estate law. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Former provisions of Article 9 applied to transactions creating security interests in fixtures, but only to extent that provision was made for fixtures in this section, and, considering Uniform Commercial Code’s definition and classification of goods, it appears that it contemplates that consumer goods may also be fixtures at least insofar as fixtures are subject to Uniform Commercial Code under this section. Williams v. Western Pac. Fin. Corp., 643 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1981) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-313).

       Where the intention of the parties was unclear as to whether a radio tower was to be a fixture and the radio tower was bolted to concrete slabs with bolts in each of the radio tower’s three legs, no guy wires secured the radio tower, the radio tower apparently could be removed from the realty without damage to the land or to the radio tower by removing these bolts and disassembling the radio tower, and the radio tower had already been removed once, the radio tower was personal property rather than a fixture.

       In a suit involving the defendant defaulting on loans secured by property that was allegedly tortuously converted by sale, the grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff was reversed, in part, because an issue of material fact remained as to whether the financing statement was valid as to the name provided on the financing statement and whether the incorrect name made the statement seriously misleading.

       Where a search of the county records did not reveal a financing statement due to a mistake in the name of the debtor shown on the financing statement, the security interest in the funds relating to the financing statement was not perfected, and the money was awarded to a judgment creditor in an interpleader action. Receivables Purchasing Co. v. R &amp; R Directional Drilling, L.L.C., <cite class="ga_app_court">263 Ga. App. 649</cite>, <cite class="app_court">588 S.E.2d 831</cite> (2003).

       Because an attorney who handled a closing in the capacity of an escrow agent for the client’s business had no actual or constructive notice of a creditor’s security interest in the business due to the improper filing pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-502" target="_self">11-9-502</a></cite>,<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-503" target="_self">11-9-503</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-506" target="_self">11-9-506</a></cite>, because the debtor’s name was not properly listed and the interest was accordingly not perfected, claims as to conversion of the business closing proceeds failed. All Bus. Corp. v. Choi, <cite class="ga_app_court">280 Ga. App. 618</cite>, <cite class="app_court">634 S.E.2d 400</cite> (2006), cert. denied, No. S06C2098, 2006 Ga. LEXIS 1016 (Ga. Nov. 20, 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Perfection of security interest in the debtor’s accounts receivable granted under the agreements was not properly perfected because neither of the two elements required for perfection by Georgia law was met: first, the debtor’s name as listed in the financing statement was inconsistent with its legal name on the public record, and moreover, a search of Georgia Superior Court Clerks’ Cooperative Authority’s Lien records for the debtor’s correct name would not have disclosed the financing statement’s existence; second, the financing statement did not indicate that the statement covered all assets or all personal property of the debtor, and the statement failed to provide a description of, or reasonably identify, the debtor’s accounts receivable subject to the security interest. Scarver v. Silverline Servs. (In re Wastetech, LLC), 605 Bankr. 264 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2019).

       Defendant’s financing statement was seriously misleading, making the financing statement ineffective under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-506ol1c" target="_self">11-9-506(c)</a></cite> because the debtor’s name on the financing statement was seriously misleading, and a search done with the filing office’s standard search logic would not have disclosed the defendant’s financing statement.

      effective July 1, 2013, substituted the present provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3), for the former provisions, which read: “(1) If the debtor is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name of the debtor indicated on the public record of the debtor’s jurisdiction of organization which shows the debtor to have been organized;

       Where a search of the county records did not reveal a financing statement due to a mistake in the name of the debtor shown on the financing statement, the security interest in the funds relating to the financing statement was not perfected, and the money was awarded to a judgment creditor in an interpleader action.

      <p>
       Financing statement showing debtor’s name only in unregistered trade name form is not legally sufficient to create security interest. In re Firth, 363 F. Supp. 369 (M.D. Ga. 1973) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing of a financing statement under a corporate debtor’s trade name, was sufficient, where business was done under the trade name and any reasonably prudent creditor would have searched the records under that name. In re Simpson Motor Co., 101 Bankr. 813 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-402).
      </p>
      <p>
       Creditor’s filing of a financing statement on the debtor’s automobiles in the debtor’s trade name rather than its legal name was sufficient, even though the creditor knew the legal name but decided not to file under it, where the debtor did business only under one trade name.

       Where real debtor has not signed financing statement in his individual capacity, but only on behalf of fictitious business entity, it is conceptually insufficient since signature of real debtor in his real name does not appear thereon.

      <p>
       While this section has effect of binding those persons who contract in fictitious names to contracts, so executed, it does not have effect of saying that financing statements given in fictitious names are sufficient to notify subsequent creditors of identity of party using the fictitious name. Were a court to hold otherwise, the purpose of statutory scheme of requiring security interest to be perfected by filing a financing statement — to give notice to future creditors of debtor — would be seriously undermined.

      <p>
       In a suit involving the defendant defaulting on loans secured by property that was allegedly tortuously converted by sale, the grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff was reversed, in part, because an issue of material fact remained as to whether the financing statement was valid as to the name provided on the financing statement and whether the incorrect name made the statement seriously misleading.

       Where creditor failed to file an amended financing statement reflecting debtor’s name change, its original filing was not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by debtor more than four months after it changed its name.

       Under Georgia law, a fixture filing contained sufficient information to put a purchaser on notice of the existence of a bond trustee’s prior unrecorded interest in the real property under an indenture, and the references in the fixture filing to the assignment and pledge of the debtor’s interest would excite the attention of a purchaser and trigger the duty to inquire further into the interest held by the bond trustee. That inquiry would include an examination of the indenture that would give the purchaser notice of the bond trustee’s mortgage and, thus, the mortgage lien was enforceable against a bona fide purchaser, and the mortgage lien was not avoidable under the Bankruptcy Code.

       A loan, null and void as a matter of law,

      <p>
       Although the provisions of a subsequent loan agreement stated: “It is understood that this Loan Agreement supersedes and cancels any previous Loan Agreements,” this language did not cancel the security agreements or financial statements previously executed by the parties, but merely served to consolidate the previous loan agreements between the parties, and where instead of filing a termination statement, creditor filed a continuation statement, continuing the earlier financing statement, the creditor’s security interest, perfected earlier in debtor’s equipment, was still valid and effective. Tidwell v. Slocumb (In re Ga. Steel, Inc.), 71 Bankr. 903 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1987) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-404).

       Where industrial loan was void from its inception as usurious, it created no “outstanding secured obligation,” and an order by the trial court awarding damages under this section was proper where the lender refused to provide a termination statement that he no longer claimed a security interest under the financing statement.

       Plaintiffs’ filing of their financing statement in the proper county gave defendant legal notice of plaintiffs’ security interests and liens in peanut crops defendant purchased, even though the clerk incorrectly recorded the financing statement, and the perfected security interests remained effective even though the crops were harvested. Bartolan, Inc. v. Columbian Peanut Co., 727 F. Supp. 1444 (M.D. Ga. 1989) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).

        Former subsection (8) was intended to save financing and continuation statements
       </b>
       that had been filed in conformity with the 1985 amendments to this article. Only secured parties who had failed to continue their perfected security interest, and secured creditors whose security interest had legitimately expired were not continued, or saved, by operation of law.

       Bank was properly perfected as a result of the filing of its financing statement and continuation statement. Former subsection (8) continued the continuation statement for a period of five years, regardless of the stated maturity date on the form. As a result of these acts, the bank would be perfected until five years after the continuation statement was filed. In re Rainbow Mfg. Co., 150 Bankr. 857 (M.D. Ga. 1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).

      <p>
       Former subsection (3) works to allow filing officers (Superior Court Clerks) to refuse to accept continuation statements until the last 6 months of the previous filing’s effectiveness. Once the new filing is accepted, however, it is in force for a period of five years, not from the filing date of the financing statement, but from the date of the filing of the new statement, under former subsection (8). In re Rainbow Mfg. Co., 150 Bankr. 857 (M.D. Ga. 1993) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuation statement filed by a secured creditor prior to the six-month period set forth in former subsection (3) was effective for five years from the date of filing and extended the creditor’s security interest in certain assets of the debtor beyond the original period of protection. Coats Am., Inc. v. Summit Nat'l Bank, 211 Bankr. 771 (N.D. Ga. 1997), aff'd, 152 F.3d 935 (11th Cir. 1998) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-403).

      <p>
       A second financing statement filed by the same creditor covering the same collateral could not be considered a continuation statement under this section, or an amendment to the original under former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-402" target="_self">11-9-402</a></cite> (see now §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-502" target="_self">11-9-502</a></cite> et seq.), but was deemed to be a back-up financing statement with its own separately established priority, and, where the debtor’s bankruptcy petition was filed while the first financing statement was still effective, creditor’s first-in time priority status under the original statement was preserved. Giddens v. Pioneer Credit, 205 Bankr. 349 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1996), amended, 205 Bankr. 349 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1997).

       The former provisions set forth general remedies of both creditor and debtor while remaining provisions of Art. 9 simply elaborated on the various remedies summarized herein, and as such, are neither mandatory nor mutually exclusive.

      <p>
       The last clause of former subsection (4) (“in which case the provisions of this part do not apply”) is itself applicable only where the creditor proceeds “as to both the real and the personal property in accordance with his rights and remedies in respect of the real property . . . ”, where the creditor sells the debtor’s personalty pursuant to debtor’s notes and security agreement and seeks to proceed against the debtor’s guarantor’s real estate for the balance pursuant to their deed. United States ex rel. FHA v.

      <p>
       Secured creditor’s election to repossess collateral and then to file suit on contract without first disposing of the collateral was not improper under the terms of the sale contracts or of the UCC. ITT Terryphone Corp. v. Modems Plus, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">171 Ga.

       Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to a bank, a secured creditor, that brought an action for money judgment on a note while holding the collateral pledged by a corporation and an individual because O.C.G.A. §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-601ol1c" target="_self">11-9-601(c)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-609ol1a1" target="_self">11-9-609(a)(1)</a></cite> allowed a secured creditor in possession of a debtor’s collateral to employ a number of different remedial steps until the debt was satisfied.

       Secured creditor’s election to repossess collateral and then to file suit on contract without first disposing of the collateral was not improper under the terms of the sale contracts or of the UCC.

       Where plaintiff’s asserted abduction during the course of having plaintiff’s car repossessed was unrefuted in the record, it could not be said as a matter of law that defendants’ alleged conduct did not amount to a breach of the peace. Roach v. Barclays-American/Credit, Inc., <cite class="ga_app_court">164 Ga. App. 616</cite>, <cite class="app_court">298 S.E.2d 304</cite> (1982) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-503" target="_self">11-9-503</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeals could not say as a matter of law that creditor’s entry into the business premises was in breach of the peace since, because debtor was not present at the time, there was no evidence of “accompanying incitement to immediate violence,” nor “unequivocal oral protest of the defaulting debtor.” Emmons v. Burkett, <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga. App. 838</cite>, <cite class="app_court">348 S.E.2d 323</cite> (1986), rev'd, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 855</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 908</cite> (1987) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-503" target="_self">11-9-503</a></cite>).

      <p>
       In an action by a debtor against a creditor-bank, recovery service, and independent contractor hired by the recovery service to repossess the debtor’s car, circumstances of debtor’s resistance to the seizure by the contractor created genuine issues of material fact as to the debtor’s claim for breach of the peace, and both the bank and recovery service could be held liable for damages based on a finding that the contractor breached the peace. Fulton v. Anchor Sav. Bank, <cite class="ga_app_court">215 Ga. App. 456</cite>, <cite class="app_court">452 S.E.2d 208</cite> (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of a creditor as to whether it could be held vicariously liable for an independent contractor’s acts in attempting to repossess a debtor’s car because the creditor had a non-delegable statutory duty under O.C.G.A. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-609" target="_self">11-9-609</a></cite> to not breach the peace in repossessing the car, and if the contractor’s attempt to repossess the car was in violation of the statute, the creditor would be chargeable with that conduct since it was done in violation of a duty imposed upon it by statute; there is nothing in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-609" target="_self">11-9-609</a></cite> that allows a secured party to avoid liability for a wrongful repossession by simply delegating this duty to an independent contractor.

       Notice only of intention to sell without any notification of time is not in compliance with Uniform Commercial Code as it precludes purchaser or owner from exercising right of redemption and therefore prevents the recovery of the deficiency.

      <p>
       Former provisions did not demand that notice specify exactly when the sales would occur. It was sufficient for the creditor to notify debtor that the sales would occur only after certain dates, and so notice requirement was satisfied. Cessna Fin. Corp. v. Wall, 876 F.

       In suit based on defaults in payment of two notes, while defendant was notified by certified mail that in event of sale plaintiff would pursue deficiency claim, this notice did not advise defendant of any contemplated sale, either public or private, thus creditor failed to comply with the former provisions, as notice is a condition precedent to recovery of any deficiency.

       In action for conversion of mortgaged property, instruction that secured party had no right to sell property if no notice was given was erroneous, as the U.C.C. does not prohibit sale without notice, but rather provides that a debtor is entitled to recover any loss caused by such a sale, that is, a loss caused by a sale at a less than adequate price, and is also protected from any action by secured party to recover any deficiency between sale price and balance owing. Trust Co. v. Kite, <cite class="ga_app_court">164 Ga.

      <p>
       A creditor who fails to comply with the provisions of the UCC as to repossessed collateral is met with two results for noncompliance: (1) It will be presumed that the value of the repossessed collateral equals the amount of the debt, and (2) even if the secured party overcomes such presumption, any recovery is subject to an offset of damages proved by the debtor resulting from the violation. Barney v. Morris, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga. App. 426</cite>, <cite class="app_court">309 S.E.2d 420</cite> (1983); Emmons v. Burkett, <cite class="ga_app_court">179 Ga.

       In an action by a debtor for damages caused by repossession of collateral after an alleged breach of an agreement between the debtor and the secured party, where the debtor is in default the debtor cannot allege that the failure of the secured party to give notice as to the retention and sale of collateral caused the debtor to be damaged by loss of profits. Such violations only raise the presumption that the value of the collateral equals the amount due on the debt. Barney v. Morris, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga.

       In a finance corporation’s suit to recover a deficiency balance on an installment sales contract for a log loader, the trial court properly granted the corporation summary judgment upon concluding that no genuine issues of material fact existed based on the defending trucking company and the company’s president failing to answer the requests for admissions that were served simultaneously with the complaint. By failing to respond and never challenging the trial court’s denial of the motion to withdraw the admissions filed by the trucking company and the company’s president, the following allegations were deemed admitted: that true and correct copies of the relevant documents, including the demand for payment were received; that the president executed the installment sales contract and the guaranty; that the president failed to make payments thereunder; that the principal balance due under the contract and guaranty was $ 34,442.44 as of a certain date; and that the money was owed to the finance corporation.

      <p>
       In a finance corporation’s suit to recover a deficiency balance on an installment sales contract for a log loader, the trial court properly granted the corporation summary judgment upon concluding that no genuine issues of material fact existed based on the defending trucking company and the company’s president failing to answer the requests for admissions that were served simultaneously with the complaint. By failing to respond and never challenging the trial court’s denial of the motion to withdraw the admissions filed by the trucking company and the company’s president, the following allegations were deemed admitted: that true and correct copies of the relevant documents, including the demand for payment were received; that the president executed the installment sales contract and the guaranty; that the president failed to make payments thereunder; that the principal balance due under the contract and guaranty was $ 34,442.44 as of a certain date; and that the money was owed to the finance corporation.

       The written notice required by former paragraph (2) must clearly state the creditor’s proposal to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the debt and must notify the debtor that the debtor has 21 days in which to raise an objection to such a proposal. Chen v. Profit Sharing Plan, <cite class="ga_app_court">216 Ga. App. 878</cite>, <cite class="app_court">456 S.E.2d 237</cite> (1995), cert. denied, No. S95C1173, 1995 Ga. LEXIS 793 (Ga.

      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of requiring written notice of a creditor’s proposal to retain collateral in lieu of the debt and of prohibiting waiver of such notice before default is to provide the debtor with options for reducing loss when collateral has a value greater than the debt via redemption pursuant to former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-506" target="_self">11-9-506</a></cite> or liquidation in a commercially reasonable manner as required by former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Even though a debtor gave possession of a note and security deed and executed a transfer and assignment of the instruments to the creditor as collateral for a loan, the instruments never vested in the creditor and the transaction was not the creation or transfer of an interest in real estate under former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-104ol1h" target="_self">11-9-104(h)</a></cite>; thus, where the creditor did not comply with the notice requirement of former paragraph (2), the debtor was entitled to recover either damages for conversion of the collateral after default or damages prescribed by former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-507" target="_self">11-9-507</a></cite>.

       Allowing a debtor to reject a secured creditor’s proposal to retain collateral in lieu of debt (after default) not only protects the debtor’s right to mitigate loss, it protects the creditor from claims of the debtor that the creditor should have disposed of the collateral.

       Creditor’s written notice of repossession, of intent not to sell at a commercially reasonable sale, and of intent to keep the property for creditor’s own use came within the ambit of former paragraph (2) and constituted an election barring the creditor’s deficiency claim.

       A debtor’s defensive pleadings alleging that the creditor’s petition failed to state a claim, the enumeration of various defenses to repossession, and a denial of all averments in the petition except jurisdiction, did not meet the requirement of this former section for a written objection to the creditor’s notice of intention to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation.

      </h4>
      <p>
       In an action by a debtor for damages caused by repossession of collateral after an alleged breach of an agreement between the debtor and the secured party, where the debtor is in default the debtor cannot allege that the failure of the secured party to give notice as to the retention and sale of collateral caused the debtor to be damaged by loss of profits. Such violations only raise the presumption that the value of the collateral equals the amount due on the debt. Barney v. Morris, <cite class="ga_app_court">168 Ga. App. 426</cite>, <cite class="app_court">309 S.E.2d 420</cite> (1983).

       Once a creditor has possession of the collateral, the creditor must act in a commercially reasonable manner and is liable for any damage sustained by the debtor as a result of breach of that duty. Thus, personalty seized by the creditor must be applied toward liquidation of the debt, and the debtor is entitled to any damage sustained as a result of any failure by the creditor to act in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to the seized personalty.

       Corporate debtor that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy was not liable to an LLC for unpaid rent that was owed by a lock and key company, even though the same individual owned both companies and the debtor had accepted collateral the lock and key company owned in full satisfaction of debt the company owed.

      <p>
       The purpose of requiring written notice of a creditor’s proposal to retain collateral in lieu of the debt and of prohibiting waiver of such notice before default is to provide the debtor with options for reducing the debtor’s loss when collateral has a value greater than the debt via redemption pursuant to former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-506" target="_self">11-9-506</a></cite> or liquidation in a commercially reasonable manner as required by former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Even though a debtor gave possession of a note and security deed and executed a transfer and assignment of the instruments to the creditor as collateral for a loan, the instruments never vested in the creditor and the transaction was not the creation or transfer of an interest in real estate under former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-104ol1h" target="_self">11-9-104(h)</a></cite>; thus, where the creditor did not comply with the notice requirement of former paragraph (2), the debtor was entitled to recover either damages for conversion of the collateral after default or damages prescribed by former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-507" target="_self">11-9-507</a></cite>.

       A creditor who fails to prove that notice of sale was given debtor (where required) or fails to prove that disposition, including its method, manner, time, place and terms, was commercially reasonable, is barred from obtaining a deficiency judgment. Farmers Bank v. Hubbard, <cite class="ga_court">247 Ga. 431</cite>, <cite class="app_court">276 S.E.2d 622</cite> (1981) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-507" target="_self">11-9-507</a></cite>).

       When the reasonableness of the sale is challenged, the seller of the collateral has the burden of proving that the sale was reasonable.

       For secured party to meet burden of proving every aspect of sale to be commercially reasonable, it must establish affirmatively that the “terms” of sale were commercially reasonable; this includes burden to show that resale price was fair and reasonable value of collateral. Granite Equip. Leasing Corp. v. Marine Dev. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">139 Ga.

       Where commercial reasonableness of sale is challenged by debtor, party holding security interest has burden of proving that terms of sale were commercially reasonable and that resale price was fair and reasonable value of collateral.

       Denial of the creditor’s motion for a directed verdict was proper since, based on the evidence presented, the jury could have determined that a sale was commercially unreasonable and that the debtor was entitled to money damages as a result.

       Presumption that value of collateral equals debt on it is overcome by proving fair and reasonable value of collateral, whereupon creditor is entitled to deficiency judgment in amount of debt (plus or minus any payments or charges properly applicable to disposition) less fair and reasonable value of collateral proved by creditor (if resale price is less than fair and reasonable value proved). Farmers Bank v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Burden is on secured party to prove value of collateral at time of repossession and that such value does not equal debt; failure to so prove results in a presumption that value was at least amount of debt.

      <p>
       In action for conversion of mortgaged property, instruction that secured party had no right to sell property if no notice was given was erroneous, as the U.C.C. does not prohibit sale without notice, but rather provides that a debtor is entitled to recover any loss caused by such a sale, that is, a loss caused by a sale at a less than adequate price, and is also protected from any action by secured party to recover any deficiency between sale price and balance owing. Trust Co. v. Kite, <cite class="ga_app_court">164 Ga.

       A secured creditor did not act in a commercially unreasonable manner when it repossessed the collateral and, without ever disposing of it, filed suit against the debtor, there being evidence that the collateral was the type of equipment which in the past the creditor had been able to dispose of at only a fraction of its original sale value. However, if it was later established that the creditor did not act in a commercially reasonable manner, the balance of the indebtedness owed on the contracts would be reduced by the value of the equipment at the time it was repossessed, plus the amount of any damage sustained as a result of the creditor’s inaction in returning or disposing of the goods.

       A secured creditor did not act in a commercially unreasonable manner when it repossessed the collateral and, without ever disposing of it, filed suit against the debtor, there being evidence that the collateral was the type of equipment which in the past the creditor had been able to dispose of at only a fraction of its original sale value. However, if it was later established that the creditor did not act in a commercially reasonable manner, the balance of the indebtedness owed on the contracts would be reduced by the value of the equipment at the time it was repossessed, plus the amount of any damage sustained as a result of the creditor’s inaction in returning or disposing of the goods.

       If the secured party does not dispose of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner, there can be no recovery of any deficiency between the sale price and the unpaid balance. Granite Equip. Leasing Corp. v. Marine Dev. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">139 Ga. App. 778</cite>, <cite class="app_court">230 S.E.2d 43</cite> (1976) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that every aspect of foreclosure sale (method, manner, time, place and terms) must be commercially reasonable is a condition precedent to recovery of any deficiency between sale price and balance remaining due on contract price, and if sale is not commercially reasonable plaintiff can recover nothing, because it is then presumed that price on foreclosure sale in fact does represent full value of article at time of repossession. Brown v. C.I.T. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">150 Ga. App. 361</cite>, <cite class="app_court">258 S.E.2d 44</cite> (1979) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).

       In Georgia, a secured party is absolutely prohibited from recovering deficiency judgment where notice is not given or sale is commercially unreasonable. Comfort Trane Air Conditioning Co. v. Trane Co., 592 F.2d 1373 (5th Cir. 1979) (decided under former Code Section 11-9-504).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though defendant debtor failed to introduce any testimony while denying claim in its entirety, burden of proof was upon secured party to prove sale was done in a commercially reasonable manner in order to recover on deficiency. Georgia Cent. Credit Union v. Coleman, <cite class="ga_app_court">155 Ga. App. 547</cite>, <cite class="app_court">271 S.E.2d 681</cite> (1980) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a loan secured by both real and personal property, the provision of this former section for liquidation of the guarantor’s personal property “in a commercially reasonable manner” did not apply where the lender chose to exercise its “rights and remedies in respect of the real property” as permitted under former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-501ol14" target="_self">11-9-501(4)</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Failure on part of secured party to establish that fair and reasonable value of collateral does not equal debt results in presumption that value of collateral disposed of is at least equal to debt, from which it follows that no deficiency judgment can be obtained.

Kennedy, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 345</cite>, <cite class="app_court">348 S.E.2d 636</cite> (1986) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).

       The rule precluding recovery of a deficiency where the secured party has failed to dispose of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner or provide the debtor with reasonable notification of the disposition is applicable where a secured creditor seeks to satisfy the deficiency either through a personal judgment or out of collateral or pursuant to a guaranty. Reeves v. Habersham Bank, <cite class="ga_court">254 Ga. 615</cite>, <cite class="app_court">331 S.E.2d 589</cite> (1985) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The rebuttable presumption rule, by placing the burden on the creditor to show the propriety of the sale and making the creditor liable for any injury to the debtor, provides an adequate deterrent to an improper sale on the part of a creditor and adequately protects the debtor’s interest, without arbitrarily penalizing the creditor. Emmons v. Burkett, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 855</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 908</cite> (1987) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the rebuttable presumption rule, if a creditor fails to give notice or conducts an unreasonable sale, the presumption is raised that the value of the collateral is equal to the indebtedness. To overcome this presumption, the creditor must present evidence of the fair and reasonable value of the collateral, and the evidence must show that such value was less than the debt. If the creditor rebuts the presumption, the creditor may maintain an action against the debtor or guarantor for any deficiency. Any loss suffered by the debtor as a consequence of the failure to give notice or to conduct a commercially reasonable sale is recoverable and may be set off against the deficiency. Emmons v. Burkett, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 855</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 908</cite> (1987) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).

       A more complete statement of the rule set forth in Emmons v. Burkette, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 855</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 908</cite> (1987), is: If the creditor conducts a commercially unreasonable sale and does not rebut the presumption that the value of the collateral is equal to the indebtedness, the creditor loses the right to recover the deficiency against the debtor and the guarantor. If the presumption is rebutted, the first to recover the deficiency remains as held in Emmons. Business Dev. Corp. v. Contestabile, <cite class="ga_court">261 Ga. 886</cite>, <cite class="app_court">413 S.E.2d 447</cite> (1992).

       Appellee secured creditor had burden of overcoming presumption that value of trucks equaled the debts on them by evidence of their fair and reasonable values, and evidence of resale prices was not sufficient to do this, nor were appellee’s affiant’s conclusory statements that they were sold in a commercially reasonable manner, thus, grant of summary judgment for appellee on claim for deficiency was error.

       If the secured party does not dispose of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner, there can be no recovery of any deficiency between the sale price and the unpaid balance. Granite Equip. Leasing Corp. v. Marine Dev. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">139 Ga.

      <p>
       Fact that every aspect of foreclosure sale (method, manner, time, place and terms) must be commercially reasonable is a condition precedent to recovery of any deficiency between sale price and balance remaining due on contract price, and if sale is not commercially reasonable plaintiff can recover nothing, because it is then presumed that price on foreclosure sale in fact does represent full value of article at time of repossession. Brown v. C.I.T. Corp., <cite class="ga_app_court">150 Ga.

        Rebuttable presumption rule. —

      </h4>
      <p>
       The rebuttable presumption rule, by placing the burden on the creditor to show the propriety of the sale and making the creditor liable for any injury to the debtor, provides an adequate deterrent to an improper sale on the part of a creditor and adequately protects the debtor’s interest, without arbitrarily penalizing the creditor. Emmons v. Burkett, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 855</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 908</cite> (1987) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the rebuttable presumption rule, if a creditor fails to give notice or conducts an unreasonable sale, the presumption is raised that the value of the collateral is equal to the indebtedness. To overcome this presumption, the creditor must present evidence of the fair and reasonable value of the collateral, and the evidence must show that such value was less than the debt. If the creditor rebuts the presumption, the creditor may maintain an action against the debtor or guarantor for any deficiency. Any loss suffered by the debtor as a consequence of the failure to give notice or to conduct a commercially reasonable sale is recoverable and may be set off against the deficiency. Emmons v. Burkett, <cite class="ga_court">256 Ga. 855</cite>, <cite class="app_court">353 S.E.2d 908</cite> (1987) (decided under former Code Section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-504" target="_self">11-9-504</a></cite>).

If the presumption is rebutted, the first to recover the deficiency remains as held in Emmons. Business Dev. Corp. v.
