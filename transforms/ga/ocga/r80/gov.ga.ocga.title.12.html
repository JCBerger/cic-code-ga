       - Trial court erred by failing to address whether a 1993 county zoning ordinance was constitutional because the record established that the landfill permit applicant raised a constitutional challenge to the zoning ordinance before the trial court in its response to the challengers' motion for partial summary judgment and, in fact, in its transfer order to the appellate court, the trial court specifically stated that the court did not rule on the applicant's constitutional argument.

       - Homeowners lacked standing to appeal consent orders entered by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources until the Director sought to enforce the orders, but the homeowners were authorized to sue those directly responsible for polluting the homeowners' property, irrespective of the homeowners' right of access to the courts; hence, the underlying intent of O.C.G.A.

       </b>
       - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C.

Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions.

       The local governments of the State of Georgia are of vital importance to the state and its citizens. The state has an essential public interest in promoting, developing, sustaining, and assisting local governments. The natural resources, environment, and vital areas of the state are also of vital importance to the state and its citizens. The state has an essential public interest in establishing minimum standards for land use in order to protect and preserve its natural resources, environment, and vital areas.  The purpose of this Code section is to provide for the department to serve these essential public interests of the state.  This Code section shall be liberally construed to achieve its purpose. This Code section is enacted pursuant to the authority granted the General Assembly in the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including, but not limited to, the authority provided in Article III, Section VI, Paragraphs I and II(a)(1) and Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs III and IV.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c02a01s12-2-8ol1b">
       The department is therefore authorized to develop minimum standards and procedures, in accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of Code Section 50-8-7.1 and in accordance with the procedures provided in Code Section 50-8-7.2 for the promulgation of minimum standards and procedures, for the protection of the natural resources, environment, and vital areas of the state, including, but not limited to, the protection of mountains, the protection of river corridors, the protection of watersheds of streams and reservoirs which are to be used for public water supply, for the protection of the purity of ground water, and for the protection of wetlands, which minimum standards and procedures shall be used by local governments in developing, preparing, and implementing their comprehensive plans as that term is defined in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of Code Section 50-8-2.

       The minimum standards and procedures for watershed protection referred to in subsection (b) of this Code section shall specifically include, but shall not be limited to, buffer areas along streams and reservoirs, land development densities, and land use activities. Local governments shall submit for approval by the department a watershed protection plan which shall include watershed protection standards and procedures. The department may adopt differing minimum standards and procedures of watershed protection based on the size of the watershed, the size or flow volume of the stream or reservoir, and whether or not the actual use of the municipal water supply is existing or proposed. Standards and procedures for buffer areas along streams and reservoirs shall comply with subsection (b) of this Code section and Code Section 12-7-6.

      The General Assembly declares its intent to ensure that if the Board of Natural Resources establishes a parking permit requirement for parking at state parks, historic sites, and recreational areas and natural areas, funding provided by the sale of parking permits by the Department of Natural Resources will be used to implement programs of maintenance and rehabilitation of facilities and structures located in the state parks, historic sites, and recreational areas and natural areas.
      The General Assembly further declares its intent that such funding may be used to carry out all aspects of the programs of maintenance and rehabilitation including, but not limited to, the employment of personnel and the acquisition of equipment and supplies. No schedule of parking fees shall be effective until adopted under the same procedure as the adoption of rules under the Administrative Procedure Act."

       The General Assembly recognizes that the State of Georgia has undertaken various efforts to revitalize the central business districts and in-town areas of municipalities in this state which have historically served as the centers for growth, commerce, and government in our metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the General Assembly reaffirms the commitment to strengthen those municipalities by encouraging the location of state facilities in central business districts. The General Assembly also reaffirms the commitment to provide leadership in the preservation of historic resources and to acquire and utilize space in suitable buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance. To this end, the state agencies shall utilize and maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties and districts, especially those located in central business areas. When implementing these policies, state agencies shall institute practices and procedures that are sensible, understandable, and compatible with current authority and that impose the least burden on, and provide the maximum benefit to, society.

       Whenever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, when locating state facilities, state agencies shall give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then state agencies shall consider other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts. State agencies shall then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order must be architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding historic district or properties. County, city, and other local governmental agencies are also encouraged to conform to this subsection.

State agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Department of Community Affairs when taking these steps.

       In implementation of this part, the Department of Community Affairs and each state agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with local governments, Indian tribes, and appropriate private organizations with the goal of enhancing participation of these parties in the state historic preservation program. Such partnerships should embody the principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and increased service to the public.

      The General Assembly finds that certain real property in Georgia, because it exhibits unique natural characteristics, special historical significance, or particular recreational value, constitutes a valuable heritage which should be available to all Georgians, now and in the future. The General Assembly further finds that much of this real property, because of Georgia's rapid progress over the past decade, has been altered, that its value as part of our heritage has been lost, and that such property which remains is in danger of being irreparably altered. The General Assembly declares, therefore, that there is an urgent public need to preserve important and endangered elements of Georgia's heritage, so as to allow present and future citizens to gain an understanding of their origins in nature and their roots in the culture of the past and to ensure a future sufficiency of recreational resources. The General Assembly asserts the public interest in the state's heritage by creating the Heritage Trust Program which shall be the responsibility of the Governor and the Department of Natural Resources and which shall seek to protect this heritage through the acquisition of fee simple title or lesser interests in valuable properties and by utilization of other available methods.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A heritage area which has been acquired by the Department of Natural Resources for the Heritage Trust Program may become dedicated as a heritage preserve after written recommendation of the board and approval by the Governor. Any other real property owned by the State of Georgia and under the custody of the department may be similarly dedicated. The written recommendation shall contain a provision which designates the best and most important use or uses to which the land is to be put. The dedication as a heritage preserve shall become effective when the written recommendation and the approval of the Governor are filed with the office of the Secretary of State. The written recommendation and the approval of the Governor shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county or counties in which the heritage preserve is located.

Title to, and the exclusive right to regulate the investigating, surveying, and recovery of, all such submerged cultural resources is declared to be in the State of Georgia; provided, however, that the Board of Natural Resources may determine and provide by rule that certain submerged cultural resources are of no cultural or economic value to the State of Georgia such that items or areas so designated are not subject to the provisions of this part, including any permit requirements of Code Section 12-3-82.

      The General Assembly finds that there is an increasing nation-wide concern over the deterioration of man's natural environment in rural as well as urban areas; that there is a serious need to study the long-term effects of our civilization on our natural environment; that while the State of Georgia is still richly endowed with relatively undisturbed natural areas, these areas are rapidly being drastically modified and even destroyed by human activities; that it is of the utmost importance to preserve examples of such areas in their natural state, not only for scientific and educational purposes but for the general well-being of our society and its people. Therefore, it shall be the purpose and function of the Department of Natural Resources to:
     </p>
     <ol>

       Use its influence and take any steps within its power to secure the preservation of such areas in an undisturbed natural state in order that such areas may:

      1/HB 214, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The Georgia General Assembly finds that Jekyll Island is home to some of the state's most treasured natural and cultural resources and it is the expressed intent of this body to ensure the preservation of these resources for the enjoyment of all Georgians now and for future generations to come. For this reason, the state shall continue its commitment
      that not less than 65 percent of the land area of Jekyll Island which lies above water at mean high tide shall remain undeveloped. Jekyll Island proudly displays one of Georgia's
      largest stretches of barrier island property. It is the expressed intent of this body that the beach areas of Jekyll Island will remain free and open for the use of the people of the state. Commercial improvement is intended to better existing and future development of the remaining 35 percent of Jekyll Island while retaining public access to the beaches for the pleasure of all of Georgia's citizens. The General Assembly further finds that the deteriorating conditions of public and commercial facilities is of great interest to the legislature and to the public and that by significantly extending the existing lease authority for the island's property, the state will thereby help to secure and encourage future investments and provide a basis for long-term revitalization of the island. Jekyll Island is recognized by this body as 'Georgia's Jewel,' and its remarkable beauties are hereby preserved so that they may continue to shine for all citizens of Georgia."

      1/HB 214, not codified by the General Assembly, provides: "The Georgia General Assembly finds that Jekyll Island is home to some of the state's most treasured natural and cultural resources and it is the expressed intent of this body to ensure the preservation of these resources for the enjoyment of all Georgians now and for future generations to come. For this reason, the state shall continue its commitment
      that not less than 65 percent of the land area of Jekyll Island which lies above water at mean high tide shall remain undeveloped. Jekyll Island proudly displays one of Georgia's
      largest stretches of barrier island property. It is the expressed intent of this body that the beach areas of Jekyll Island will remain free and open for the use of the people of the state. Commercial improvement is intended to better existing and future development of the remaining 35 percent of Jekyll Island while retaining public access to the beaches for the pleasure of all of Georgia's citizens. The General Assembly further finds that the deteriorating conditions of public and commercial facilities is of great interest to the legislature and to the public and that by significantly extending the existing lease authority for the island's property, the state will thereby help to secure and encourage future investments and provide a basis for long-term revitalization of the island. Jekyll Island is recognized by this body as 'Georgia's Jewel,' and its remarkable beauties are hereby preserved so that they may continue to shine for all citizens of Georgia."

       In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign rents, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority.

       Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. The resolution or the trust indenture may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such original purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued.

       The authority shall, on or before July 1, 1996, cause to be created a master plan for the management, preservation, protection, and development of each of its projects as defined in Code Section 12-3-291. The master plans for adjacent or contiguous projects may be combined into one document. The master plan for a project shall delineate, based upon aerial or other appropriate means of survey, the present and presently anticipated future uses of the land area of each project and shall also designate areas to be managed as environmentally sensitive, historically sensitive, and active use areas.

      <li id="t12c03a07p02s12-3-298ol1a">
       The authority shall have the power and is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost, as defined in Code Section 12-3-291, of any one project or a combination of projects. The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from a special fund provided for in this Code section. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at the lowest attainable rate, payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution in providing for the issuance of the bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c03a07p02s12-3-298ol1b">
       The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or the denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c03a07p02s12-3-298ol1c">
       All bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be an officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c03a07p02s12-3-298ol1d">
       Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from taxation in the State of Georgia.

       Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under this part shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members.

       Revenue bonds issued under this part shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of Georgia or a pledge of the faith and credit of the state, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund provided for in this Code section. The issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment thereof. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their faces covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this subsection.

      <li id="t12c03a07p02s12-3-298ol1h">
       In the discretion of the authority, any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign rents, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture itself may contain such provisions for perfecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project or projects; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys and revenues. The resolution or trust indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

No holder of such bonds shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon, or to enforce the payment thereof against the property of the state, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state.

       The authority or any authority or body which may succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority is authorized at one time, or from time to time, to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost, as defined in this part, of any one project or a combination of projects. The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided in subsection (n) of this Code section for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall mature at such times and bear interest at such rates as may be determined by the authority, payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds.

       The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company inside or outside the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest.

       In case any officer whose signature appears on any bonds or whose facsimile signature appears on any coupon ceases to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such person had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairperson or vice chairperson of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary or assistant secretary of the authority; and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairperson or vice chairperson of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person, and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office.

In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more, including a combination of, projects at any one institution or any number of institutions. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under this part shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted.

All such bonds shall contain recitals on their faces covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this Code section. Anything in this Code section to the contrary notwithstanding, such funds as may be received from state appropriations or from any other source are declared to be available and may be used by any department, board, commission, or agency of the State of Georgia for the performance of any lease contract entered into by such department, board, commission, or agency with the authority.

         Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys. The resolution or indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. The resolution or indenture may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued.

Upon receipt of one or more proposals, the hall of fame authority shall conduct a staff review of each proposal received. A primary consideration in the review of the proposals shall be the effect of each proposal on the current and future operating budgets of the authority and self-sustainability of the authority, including a determination of whether cost savings and operational efficiencies can be effected through moving to a new location or alternative ownership, management, and operation at the same location as proposed. Upon completion of the staff review, the findings shall be submitted to the governing body of the hall of fame authority. Each hall of fame authority shall not later than April 30, 2011, submit to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairpersons of the Senate and House appropriations committees a report detailing the activities of the authority with respect to issuance of the request for proposals, receipt and evaluation of proposals, and the decision of the authority with respect to acceptance of proposals.

     <p>
      The Georgia Sports Hall of Fame Authority and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame Authority shall to the maximum extent possible work jointly to realize efficiencies and economies in the operation of their adjacent facilities. The two authorities shall make all possible efforts to consolidate and coordinate marketing, operational, maintenance, property management, and other activities so as to achieve such efficiencies and economies. Not later than September 30, 2010, each such hall of fame authority shall issue a request for proposals for a new location or alternative ownership, management, and operation at the same location for the respective hall of fame facility. Such requests for proposals shall be disseminated to each county and municipal governing authority in the state and shall require that any proposal be submitted not later than December 31, 2010. Any county or municipality wherein such a hall of fame authority is located shall be eligible to submit a proposal; and it is the intention of the General Assembly that such a proposal shall be required as a condition for continued state funding support in a current location. Upon receipt of one or more proposals, the hall of fame authority shall conduct a staff review of each proposal received. A primary consideration in the review of the proposals shall be the effect of each proposal on the current and future operating budgets of the authority and self-sustainability of the authority, including a determination of whether cost savings and operational efficiencies can be effected through moving to a new location or alternative ownership, management, and operation at the same location as proposed. Upon completion of the staff review, the findings shall be submitted to the governing body of the hall of fame authority. Each hall of fame authority shall not later than April 30, 2011, submit to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairpersons of the Senate and House appropriations committees a report detailing the activities of the authority with respect to issuance of the request for proposals, receipt and evaluation of proposals, and the decision of the authority with respect to acceptance of proposals.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide for the conservation of nongame species of wildlife for the benefit and nonconsumptive use of the citizens of Georgia. Historically, wildlife conservation programs have been focused on the more recreationally and commercially important game species. As a consequence, such programs have been largely financed by hunting and fishing license revenues and by federal assistance based on excise taxes on certain hunting and fishing equipment. These traditional financing mechanisms are neither adequate nor fully appropriate to meet the needs of nongame wildlife conservation programs and wildlife habitat acquisition programs which enhance the protection of nongame species. It is the policy of this state to enable and encourage citizens voluntarily to support nongame wildlife conservation programs and wildlife habitat acquisition programs.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that its duty to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state requires that adequate protection of underground fresh water supplies be assured in any drilling operation which may penetrate through any stratum which contains fresh water. This duty further requires that adequate protection be assured in any drilling or the use of such drilled wells in certain other environmentally sensitive areas or in other circumstances where the result of such drilling and use may endanger the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state. It is not the policy of the General Assembly to regulate the drilling of shallow exploration or engineering holes except in such environmentally sensitive areas as defined in this part. The General Assembly further finds and declares that oil and gas exploration to identify new sources of energy should not occur at the expense of our important natural resources such as residential, municipal, and industrial supplies of fresh water. The General Assembly further finds and declares that it should continue to encourage oil and gas exploration. The General Assembly further finds and declares that with an increase in oil exploration, it must provide assurances to persons engaging in such exploration that adequate safeguards regarding results of exploration will remain privileged information for a specified time. The General Assembly further finds and declares that it is in the public interest to obtain, protect, and disseminate all possible geologic information associated with drilling operations in order to further the purposes of future energy related research.

      <li id="t12c04a02p02s12-4-45ol1a">
       In regard to the establishment of drilling units and operation units, the allocation of production, the integration of separately owned tracts of land, and agreements in the interest of conservation, the board, in addition to the jurisdiction, authority, or powers granted elsewhere in this part, shall have the specific powers with respect to the exploration or production of oil or gas enumerated below.
       <ol>
        <li id="t12c04a02p02s12-4-45ol1a1">
         Drilling units. For the prevention of waste and to avoid the augmenting and accumulation of risk arising from the drilling of an excessive number of wells, the board shall, after due investigation and a hearing, have full power and authority to establish such drilling unit or units as may, in its discretion, seem most reasonable and practicable. The board shall have control of the allocation of production over such units and shall, after investigation and hearing, set up, establish, and allocate to each unit its just and equitable share of production, and shall make such orders, rules, and regulations as will give to each producer the opportunity to use his or her just and equitable share of the reservoir energy of any pool. The board shall have power after notice and hearing to review and approve, or disapprove, agreements made among owners or operators, or among owners and operators in the interest of conservation of oil or gas or both or for the prevention of waste. When two or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced within an established drilling unit, the owners thereof may validly agree to integrate their interests and to develop their lands as a drilling unit. Where, however, such owners have not agreed to integrate their interests, the board may, for the prevention of waste or to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, after notice and hearing, require such owners to do so and to develop their lands as a drilling unit. Should the owners of separate tracts embraced within a drilling unit fail to agree upon the integration of the tracts and the drilling of a well on the unit, and should it be established that the board is without authority to require integration as provided for above, then subject to all other applicable provisions of this part, the owner of each tract embraced within the drilling unit may drill on his or her tract, but the allowable production from said tract shall be such proportion of the allowable production for the full drilling unit as the area of such separately owned tracts bears to the full drilling unit.

Such order shall be effective immediately. Any person against whom such order is directed shall upon appropriate notice comply therewith immediately but on application to the director shall be afforded a hearing before an administrative law judge appointed by the board within ten days of receipt of such application by the director or, if the party applying so requests, within 48 hours of receipt of such application by the director.

       "Affected land" construed.
       
       - Term "affected land" as utilized in paragraph (1) of this section is a technical concept; land which might be commonly termed affected in the everyday sense of the word only falls within the technical concept if the affecting operations take place after the effective date of this section. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-30 (see O.C.G.A.

       "Affected land" is to be defined to include each clause separately within the definition. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-30.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        "Affected land" includes

       lands used as a spoil area beyond an actual mining pit location and lands previously affected by surface mining operations and subjected to additional excavation of minerals or deposition of spoilage. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-291.
      </p>
      <p>
       What constitutes "overburden".
       
       - Surface waters of an area that is diked and pumped so as to permit mining directly from exposed deposits can constitute overburden subject to coverage of paragraph (8) of this section. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-25 (see O.C.G.A.

       Scope of "pit".
       
       - "Pit" as defined in paragraph (10) of this section is limited to dry land borrow pits, not dredging operations. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-35 (see O.C.G.A.

       When "surface mining" occurs.
       
       - Surface mining, as defined in paragraph (15), occurs when mining involves the removal of the earth and other materials lying above natural deposits so as to mine directly from the natural deposits thereby exposed; the mining must be directly from exposed natural deposits and not indirectly through another medium. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-25 (see O.C.G.A.

      </p>
      <p>
       On-site grading and excavation preparatory to construction is excluded from the definition of "surface mining" because such excavation and on-site preparation do not involve mining for sale, processing, or consumption in the regular operation of a business. 1970 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 70-33.

       To obtain from the director of the division a permit to conduct surface mining operations in the specified area to be mined prior to commencing the operation of same, provided that where a change in ownership of a mining operation occurs, the new owners may continue such operation on condition that a valid application, mining land use plan, and bond sufficient as to form and content for final approval are placed on file with the director within 60 days from date of consummation of the ownership change.  In the event the new owners fail to place on file with the director the necessary documents for permitting within said 60 day period, all activities associated with removal of minerals or ores from the premises shall cease.  It is further provided that a mining operator who continues to conduct a surface mining operation under a previous owner's permit in accordance with this paragraph shall be subject to having said permit revoked in the same manner and under the same conditions as a mining operator conducting a surface mining operation under his own permit. The application for a permit shall be made on a form provided by the director. The permit shall be issued on evidence satisfactory to the director of compliance with this part and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this part, and the permit shall be conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with the approved mining land use plan;

       To file a bond with the director within 60 days after the date of being furnished approved surety bond forms by the division; provided, however, that any mining operator who desires to be exempted from the bonding requirement shall request an exemption from such bonding requirement from the director, whereupon a mining operator may be exempted from such bonding requirement at the discretion of the director.  Any mining operator who has been granted an exemption from the bonding requirement and who subsequently violates any of the provisions of this part or the rules and regulations promulgated under this part, or who defaults on his obligations under any mining land use plan, may be required by the director to post a bond in accordance with this paragraph. Any bond filed with the director shall be written by a surety approved by the director and authorized to transact business in this state. Such bond shall be fixed by the director in an amount not more than $2,500.00 per acre, or fraction thereof, of the area of affected land. Such bond shall further be payable to the Governor and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this part and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this part. Mining operators shall have the option of posting bond, government securities, cash, or any combination thereof on each mined area.  In determining the amount of bond, government securities, or cash within the above limits, the director shall take into consideration the character and nature of the land reclamation requirements as approved in the operator's mining land use plan. For each permit, the director shall review and reevaluate at least every five years the site operation, objectives of the land use plan, and estimated cost factors for completion of the plan and shall require adjustments to bonding amounts as may be necessary to ensure adequate funding for site reclamation.  The bond, government securities, or cash shall be held by the division until the affected land or any portion thereof is satisfactorily reclaimed, in the opinion of the director, at which time the bond, government securities, or cash or portion thereof shall be terminated or returned to the mining operator, provided that where a mining operator fails or refuses to complete any of his responsibilities under a mining land use plan and the bond, government securities, or cash are consequently recovered upon or forfeited, the director may expend as he deems appropriate that portion of such recovered or forfeited funds as is necessary to complete such mining operator's responsibilities under the mining land use plan.  A mining operator, upon approval of an amended mining land use plan, shall file with the director the appropriate bond, government securities, or cash to cover the plan as amended, unless otherwise exempted from the bonding requirement.

     <p>
      The State of Georgia finds that caves are uncommon geologic phenomena and that the minerals deposited therein may be rare and occur in unique forms of great beauty which are irreplaceable if destroyed. It is also found that the wildlife which have evolved to live in caves are unusual and of limited numbers, and many are rare and endangered species, and that caves are a natural conduit for ground-water flow and are highly subject to water pollution, which has far-reaching effects transcending man's property boundaries. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state and the intent of this article to protect these unique natural resources.

The director shall consider all measures implemented by such political subdivision or local government authority prior to issuing fines, sanctions, or other penalties applicable, if any, for such failure.

       The people of the State of Georgia are dependent upon the rivers, streams, lakes, and subsurface waters of the state for public and private water supply and for agricultural, industrial, and recreational uses. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the State of Georgia that the water resources of the state shall be utilized prudently for the maximum benefit of the people, in order to restore and maintain a reasonable degree of purity in the waters of the state and an adequate supply of such waters, and to require where necessary reasonable usage of the waters of the state and reasonable treatment of sewage, industrial wastes, and other wastes prior to their discharge into such waters. To achieve this end, the government of the state shall assume responsibility for the quality and quantity of such water resources and the establishment and maintenance of a water quality and water quantity control program adequate for present needs and designed to care for the future needs of the state, provided that nothing contained in this article shall be construed to waive the immunity of the state for any purpose.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c05a02s12-5-21ol1b">
       The achievement of the purposes described in subsection (a) of this Code section requires that the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources be charged with the duty described in that subsection, and that it have the authority to regulate the withdrawal, diversion, or impoundment of the surface waters of the state, and to require the use of reasonable methods after having considered the technical means available for the reduction of pollution and economic factors involved to prevent and control the pollution of the waters of the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c05a02s12-5-21ol1c">
       Further, it is the intent of this article to establish within the executive branch of the government administrative facilities and procedures for determining improper usage of the surface waters of the state and pollution of the waters of the state, and to confer discretionary administrative authority upon the Environmental Protection Division to take these and related circumstances into consideration in its decisions and actions in determining, under the conditions and specific cases, those procedures which will best protect the public interest.

       to provide necessary social or economic development, and a permit to allow the county to discharge 40 million gallons of treated wastewater into a lake on a daily basis did not require the highest and best level of treatment practicable under existing technology because: (1) the projected population growth in the county would require additional wastewater capacity by the year 2005, and continued growth would require the level of capacity provided by the permit sometime between 2010 and 2015; (2) sufficient land was not available for land application of wastewater; and (3) there was a need to return water to the water system from which the county draws the county's water supply, and the cycling of treated wastewater taken from the Chattahoochee River system and returned to that system would aid negotiations concerning an interstate compact regarding these waters.

       The standards for water quality of each lake shall take into account the geographic location of the lake within the state and the location of the lake within its watershed as well as horizontal and vertical variations of hydrological conditions within each lake.  The director shall also establish nutrient limits for each of the lakes' major tributary streams, including streams with permitted discharges.  Such limits shall be consistent with the requirements of subsection (b) of this Code section and shall be established on the basis of accepted limnological techniques and as necessary in accordance with the legal and technical principles for total maximum daily loads.  The nutrient limits for tributary streams shall be established at the same time that the lake water quality standards are established.

The duration of each study shall not exceed two years.  A scientific report on each comprehensive study shall be published within 180 days after the completion of the study.  Draft recommendations for numerical criteria for each of the water quality parameters will be simultaneously published, taking into account the scientific findings.  A public notice of the draft recommendations, including a copy of the recommendations, will be made available to the public.  Public notice in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," shall be provided for such recommendations.  The notice shall be made available at least 30 days prior to board action in a regional public library or county courthouse. The recommendation will be provided to persons submitting a written request.  A comment period of not less than 45 days nor more than 60 days will be provided.

       The General Assembly seeks, through the enactment of this Code section, to set standards limiting the amount of nutrients in various cleaning agents.  The General Assembly realizes that the nutrients contained in many of these products serve a valuable purpose in increasing their overall effectiveness, but the General Assembly is also aware that they overstimulate the growth of aquatic life and are causing, and will eventually lead to, an acceleration of the natural eutrophication process of our state's water resources which can result in a lower quality of life and thereby create an undesirable environment in which the citizens of the state would not want to live and do business.

        Interpretation of narrative standard rule as to discharges.

       - Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division's (EPD's) interpretation of the narrative standard was entitled to deference as it was proper for the EPD to interpret the narrative standard as not intended to convert the designated use of a water body to a more protected use as the plain language of the narrative standard does not specify the degree of interference with legitimate water uses that would constitute a violation of the rule.

       As used in this Code section, the term "combined sewer overflow" or "CSO" means a sewage system so designed or constructed as to allow surface-water runoff to enter the conduit carrying sewage, industrial waste, or other waste and, when such conduit exceeds its maximum capacity, allows a discharge which bypasses the normal treatment works integral to such sewage system and allows untreated or incompletely treated sewage, industrial waste, or other waste to flow, directly or indirectly, into the waters of the state.

       After March 31, 1992, no person shall operate a CSO in this state unless he has obtained a permit to do so from the director.  The director, under the conditions he prescribes, shall require the submission of such plans, specifications, and other information as he deems relevant in connection with the issuance of such permits.  Compliance with permit limits shall be required for all CSO discharges under design conditions as determined by the director.

       The director is authorized to require as conditions in permits issued under this Code section the achievement of effluent limitations established pursuant to this article.  In imposing effluent limitations as conditions in such permits, the director shall base his determination upon the assessment of technology and processes unrelated to the quality of receiving waters of this state.  Effluent limitations required as conditions of such permits shall be achieved in the shortest reasonable period of time consistent with state law and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended. The director is further authorized to set schedules of compliance and include such schedules within the terms and conditions of such permits for the operation of a CSO and to prescribe terms and conditions for such permits to assure compliance with applicable effluent limitations and water quality criteria established pursuant to this article, including, but not limited to, requirements concerning recording, reporting, monitoring, and inspection to the extent permissible under this article and such other requirements as are consistent with the purposes of this article.

       Each permit issued pursuant to this Code section shall have a fixed term of five years and may be renewed by the director in accordance with such guidelines as he shall prescribe but only after the director has issued a written finding, based upon actual investigation, that the applicant has substantially followed any schedules of compliance established pursuant to subsection (c) of this Code section.

If submitted after July 1, 1991, or, regardless of when submitted, if it is based upon a withdrawal of ground water for farm uses occurring or proposed to occur on or after July 1, 1988, an application shall be subject to evaluation and classification pursuant to Code Sections 12-5-96 and 12-5-97, but a permit based upon such evaluation and classification shall be issued to ensure the applicant's right to a reasonable use of such ground water. Applications under this Code section submitted on or after April 20, 2006, for farm use within the Flint River basin shall be assessed a nonrefundable application fee in the amount of $250.00 per application. Any permit issued pursuant to this Code section shall be further conditioned upon the requirement that the permittee shall provide, on forms prescribed by the director, information relating to a general description of the lands and number of acres subject to irrigation and the permit; the name and address of the permittee; a description of the general type of irrigation system used; well construction; and pump information, including rated capacity, pump setting depth, and power information.

     </h3>
     <p>
      As a guide to the interpretation and application of this part, it is declared to be the policy of the State of Georgia that the drinking waters of the state shall be utilized prudently to the maximum benefit of the people and that the quality of such waters shall be considered a major factor in the health and welfare of all people in the State of Georgia. To achieve this end, the government of the state shall assume responsibility for the quality of such waters and the establishment and maintenance of a water-supply program adequate for present needs and designed to care for the future needs of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      This requires that an agency of the state be charged with this duty and that it have the authority to require the use of reasonable methods, that is, those methods which are economically and technologically feasible, to ensure adequate water of the highest quality for water-supply systems. Because of substantial and scientifically significant variations in the characteristics, usage, and effect upon public interest of the various surface and underground waters of the state, uniform requirements will not necessarily apply to all waters or segments thereof. It is the intent of this part to confer discretionary administrative authority upon such agency to take the above and related circumstances into consideration in its decisions and actions in determining, under the conditions prevailing in specific cases, those procedures to best protect the public interests.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources shall be the state agency to administer the provisions of this part consistent with the above-stated policy.

       12-5-231. Legislative findings and declarations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that coastal sand dunes, beaches, sandbars, and shoals comprise a vital natural resource system, known as the sand-sharing system, which acts as a buffer to protect real and personal property and natural resources from the damaging effects of floods, winds, tides, and erosion. It is recognized that the coastal sand dunes are the most inland portion of the sand-sharing system and that because the dunes are the fragile product of shoreline evolution, they are easily disturbed by actions harming their vegetation or inhibiting their natural development. The General Assembly further finds that offshore sandbars and shoals are the system's first line of defense against the potentially destructive energy generated by winds, tides, and storms, and help to protect the onshore segment of the system by acting as reservoirs of sand for the beaches. Removal of sand from these bars and shoals can interrupt natural sand flows and can have unintended, undesirable, and irreparable effects on the entire sand-sharing system, particularly when the historical patterns of sand and water flows are not considered and accommodated. Also, it is found that ocean beaches provide an unparalleled natural recreation resource which has become vitally linked to the economy of Georgia's coastal zone and to that of the entire state. The General Assembly further finds that this natural resource system is costly, if not impossible, to reconstruct or rehabilitate once adversely affected by man related activities and is important to conserve for the present and future use and enjoyment of all citizens and visitors to this state and that the sand-sharing system is an integral part of Georgia's barrier islands, providing great protection to the state's marshlands and estuaries. The General Assembly further finds that this sand-sharing system is a vital area of the state and is essential to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens of the state. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the management of the sand-sharing system has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and consequently is properly a matter for regulation under the police power of the state. The General Assembly further finds and declares that activities and structures on offshore sandbars and shoals, for all purposes except federal navigational activities, must be regulated to ensure that the values and functions of the sand-sharing system are not impaired. It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this part to protect this vital natural resource system by allowing only activities and alterations of the sand dunes and beaches which are considered to be in the best interest of the state and which do not substantially impair the values and functions of the sand-sharing system and by authorizing the local units of government of the State of Georgia to regulate activities and alterations of the ocean sand dunes and beaches and recognizing that, if the local units of government fail to carry out the policies expressed in this part, it is essential that the department undertake such regulation.

       The committee shall take action on each permit application within 90 days after the application is completed; provided, however, that this provision may be waived upon the written request of the applicant. An application is complete when it contains substantially all of the written information, documents, forms, fees, and materials required by this part. An application must be completed sufficiently in advance of the committee meeting at which the project will be considered to allow for public notice and evaluation by the committee.

       After receipt of a completed application and at least 15 days prior to acting on the application, the committee shall notify all persons identified by the applicant as owning land adjacent to the location of the proposed project and to all persons who have filed a written request with the committee that their names be placed on a mailing list for receipt of such notice. Any person desiring to be placed on such mailing list must so request in writing and renew such request in December of each year. The name of any person who has not renewed such request shall be removed from the list. The landowners who have not requested to be placed on a mailing list shall be notified in writing if their addresses are known. Such notice shall be in writing and shall include a general description of the proposed project and its location. The applicant shall post such notice in a conspicuous place on the subject property at or prior to the time the committee issues public notice of the application. If the applicant has filed an affidavit that the names or addresses of the adjoining landowners were not ascertained after a diligent search, the committee shall cause a notice of the proposed activity and a brief description of the land to be affected to be published in the legal organ or a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which such land lies. Cost of such public notices shall be paid by the applicant. Whenever there appears to be sufficient public interest, the committee may call a public hearing.

       12-5-281. Legislative findings and declarations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that the coastal marshlands of Georgia comprise a vital natural resource system.
      It is recognized that the estuarine area of Georgia is the habitat of many species of marine life and wildlife and, without the food supplied by the marshlands, such marine life and wildlife cannot survive.
      The General Assembly further finds that intensive marine research has revealed that the estuarine marshlands of coastal Georgia are among the richest providers of nutrients in the world. Such marshlands provide a nursery for commercially and recreationally important species of shellfish and other wildlife, provide a great buffer against flooding and erosion, and help control and disseminate pollutants.
      Also, it is found that the coastal marshlands provide a natural recreation resource which has become vitally linked to the economy of Georgia's coastal zone and to that of the entire state.
      The General Assembly further finds that this coastal marshlands resource system is costly, if not impossible, to reconstruct or rehabilitate once adversely affected by man related activities and is important to conserve for the present and future use and enjoyment of all citizens and visitors to this state.
      The General Assembly further finds that the coastal marshlands are a vital area of the state and are essential to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens of the state. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the management of the coastal marshlands has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and consequently is properly a matter for regulation under the police power of the state.
      The General Assembly further finds and declares that activities and structures in the coastal marshlands must be regulated to ensure that the values and functions of the coastal marshlands are not impaired and to fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as public trustees of the coastal marshlands for succeeding generations.

       There is created the Coastal Marshlands Protection Committee to be composed of five members. The commissioner of natural resources and four persons selected by the board shall be the members of this committee. Each of three persons selected by the board shall be a resident of Camden, Glynn, McIntosh, Liberty, Bryan, or Chatham County. Three members of the committee shall constitute a quorum. The committee shall issue all orders and shall grant, deny, revoke, and amend all permits and leases provided for by this part. The members of the committee shall be entitled to reimbursement of actual expenses and mileage together with a per diem as set by the board to be paid out of funds appropriated for use by the department.

       Any person who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any order or action of the committee shall, upon petition within 30 days after the issuance of such order or the taking of such action, have a right to a hearing before an administrative law judge appointed by the board.  The hearing before the administrative law judge shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," and the rules and regulations adopted by the board pursuant thereto. The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute the final decision of the board and any party to the hearing, including the committee, shall have the right of judicial review thereof in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50.

       Persons are "aggrieved or adversely affected" where the challenged action has caused or will cause them injury in fact and where the injury is to an interest within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by this part.  In the event the committee asserts in response to the petition before the administrative law judge that the petitioner is not aggrieved or adversely affected, the administrative law judge shall take evidence and hear arguments on this issue and thereafter make a ruling on this issue before continuing with the hearing.  The burden of going forward with evidence on this issue shall rest with the petitioner.

      <li id="t12c05a04p04s12-5-283ol1d">
       Any permit for minor alteration of the marshlands may be issued by the commissioner based on the recommendations of staff, past committee actions, and the results of public comments.  The commissioner may refer the application to the committee to decide on permits for minor alterations that, in his judgment, should receive broader consideration.  A committee member may choose to have the full committee decide on permit applications for minor alterations that the member feels should receive broader consideration.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that the coastal area of Georgia comprises a vital natural resource system. The General Assembly recognizes that the coastal area of Georgia is the habitat of many species of marine life and wildlife which must have clean waters and suitable habitat to survive. The General Assembly further finds that intensive research has revealed that activities affecting the coastal area may degrade water quality or damage coastal resources if not properly planned and managed. The General Assembly further finds that the coastal area provides a natural recreation resource which has become vitally linked to the economy of Georgia's coast and to that of the entire state. The General Assembly further finds that resources within this coastal area are costly, if not impossible, to reconstruct or rehabilitate once adversely affected by human related activities and it is important to conserve these resources for the present and future use and enjoyment of all citizens and visitors to this state. The General Assembly further finds that the coastal area is a vital area of the state and that it is essential to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens of the state. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the management of the coastal area has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and consequently is properly a matter for coordinated regulation under the police power of the state. The General Assembly further finds and declares that activities and structures in the coastal area must be regulated to ensure that the values and functions of coastal waters and natural habitats are not impaired and to fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as public trustees of the coastal waters and habitats for succeeding generations.

       Any person who desires to construct a dam but has not commenced such construction as of July 1, 1978, shall obtain a permit from the director to construct a dam prior to commencement of construction. Any person who is operating a dam or who is in the physical process of constructing a dam as of July 1, 1978, shall obtain a permit from the director for such operation or construction, provided that the person may continue to operate or construct such dam pending final action by the director on the application for a permit; provided, further, that such application has been filed with the director within 180 days after the director serves upon the person a written notice that such dam has been classified as a category I dam in accordance with Code Section 12-5-375. Service of notice upon the person shall be made by delivering the notice to the person or by mailing it to the person by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery at the person's home or business address. Service by mail is complete upon mailing unless the notice is returned to the director by the U.S. Postal Service for any reason other than a refusal by the person to accept the mailing. Permits issued for the construction of dams pursuant to this part shall also authorize the operation of such dams in accordance with the conditions contained in such permits.

       If the director reclassifies a dam formerly classified as a category II dam as a category I dam because of modification in the dam or because of changing circumstances, the director shall serve upon the owner or operator of the dam a written notice of the director's determination regarding the dam. Within 180 days after such service of notice, the owner or operator shall apply to the director for a permit to operate the dam. Notice shall be served in accordance with subsection (a) of this Code section. Such owner or operator may continue to operate the dam pending final action by the director on the application for a permit. A permit to operate such dam shall be issued in accordance with the requirements of subsection (g) of this Code section, notwithstanding the date specified in said subsection (g).

After any such visual inspection, and upon a finding by the director that a dam is not in compliance with any provision of this part or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, the director may issue an administrative order to the owner of such dam requiring such owner to undertake, at the owner's expense, such maintenance, alterations, repairs, reconstruction, change in construction or location, or removal as may be deemed necessary by the director, or the draining or lowering of the water level of the dam, within the time period specified in such administrative order.

       Based upon a visual inspection of a dam, if the director determines that the dam is not in compliance with this part or any rule and regulation promulgated hereunder, and there is not sufficient time to issue an administrative order, the director may immediately take such measures as may be necessary to provide emergency protection to life or property, including lowering the reservoir level or destroying in whole or in part the barrier and impoundment. The costs of such emergency measures may be recovered by the state in an action brought in the superior court of the county in which the dam is located or the county of residence of the dam owner.

       The General Assembly finds that adequate supplies of clean water for drinking and other purposes constitute the lifeblood of the great metropolitan areas of this state and are, therefore, essential to the health, welfare, and economic progress of the state; that development adjacent to major streams in certain metropolitan areas requires special regulation to provide adequate protection for public water supplies; that siltation and urban runoff threaten such water supplies; that flood plain development unnecessarily exposes life and property to loss by flooding while increasing flood risks for other areas; that over-intensive development adjacent to major streams increases the frequency and severity of such flooding; that it is in the public interest to avoid future flood damage and possible loss of life, to control erosion and pollution, and to protect the water quality of major streams in certain metropolitan areas.

       The General Assembly finds that the stream corridors of major streams in certain metropolitan areas as set forth in this part are vital areas within the meaning of Article III, Section VIII, Paragraph IIIA of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1976 and Article III, Section VI, Paragraph II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983. The purpose of this part is to provide a method whereby political subdivisions in certain metropolitan areas shall utilize the police power of the state, in accordance with a comprehensive plan, to protect consistently the water quality of any major stream, the public water supplies of such political subdivision and of the area, recreational values of the major stream, and private property rights of landowners; to prevent activities which contribute to floods and flood damage; to control erosion, siltation, and intensity of development; to provide for the location and design of land uses in such a way as to minimize the adverse impact of development on the major stream and flood plains; and to provide for comprehensive planning for the stream corridor in such areas.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c05a05p06s12-5-442ol1c">
       The General Assembly finds that certain political subdivisions in the included area have in force certain flood plain and sediment control ordinances that afford adequate protection for the aforementioned problems. Nothing in this part shall be construed so as to make those local political subdivision ordinances less stringent than they are now.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c05a05p06s12-5-442ol1d">
       The General Assembly intends to authorize and require political subdivisions in any such area to enforce this part so as to protect the watercourse and the adjacent stream corridor. The General Assembly further intends that the state have the authority to enforce this part if the appropriate political subdivisions have failed or refused to do so and if the public interest requires it.

The failure of any owner to actually receive such notice shall not affect the applicability of the plan to such owner's property or create any cause of action for damages or equitable relief. The plan, as adopted by the commission, shall be transmitted to each political subdivision by June 16, 1973. The plan as adopted by the commission for any and all land brought within the stream corridor after March 1, 1983, shall be transmitted to each political subdivision and to the director by July 1, 1983.

       The General Assembly declares its intent and the public policy of this state that the state plans, regulates, and controls the withdrawal and the use of the waters of the state under the laws of Georgia to protect the public health, safety, and welfare; and the granting of any water withdrawal permit allows the permittee to use the water solely for the stated purposes described in the permit so long as such use is consistent with the public welfare of the state and upon such conditions as the state may prescribe. This declaration of intent shall also apply to all aspects of this article.

       The General Assembly finds that the use of water resources for the state for agricultural purposes is of vital importance to Georgia and southwest Georgia in particular; the protection of flows in the Flint River and its tributaries is necessary for a healthy riverine ecosystem and a healthy population of aquatic life; the use of water resources during drought conditions may interfere with public and private rights; the economic well-being of the State of Georgia is dependent on a strong and efficient agricultural industry; the wise use of water, the protection of stream flows, and the economic well-being of the state will be furthered by proper water allocation in periods of drought; and programs to augment stream flows or provide incentives to ensure that certain irrigated lands are temporarily not irrigated during severe droughts will promote the wise use of water resources, and the protection of stream flows for habitat critical for aquatic life, and the economic well-being of the state.

       The General Assembly declares its intent to fund the execution of the public policy set forth in subsection (b) of this Code section by and through the authority with appropriated funds for the purposes of this article, grants, and other sources of revenue. The General Assembly intends for the total maximum balance of the unexpended drought protection funds during any fiscal year not to exceed $30 million. In the event the total balance of unexpended drought protection funds at the end of a fiscal year is less than $5 million, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the total balance of unexpended drought protection funds be replenished to at least $10 million at the earliest possible time. Appropriation of funds for inclusion in and as part of the drought protection funds shall be deemed consistent with this declaration of legislative intent.

       On or before March 1 of each year, the division may issue a prediction as to whether severe drought conditions are expected during the year. If the division predicts a severe drought during any particular year, it shall issue such prediction before March 1 of that year. Prediction of severe drought may be based on consideration of historical, mathematical, or meteorological information, including, but not limited to, stream flows, ground-water levels, and precipitation forecasts. Such prediction may also be based on scientific analyses, including, but not limited to, the Palmer Drought Severity Index administered by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

Upon such determination, the division may conduct an irrigation reduction auction whereby a permittee of an irrigation system located within the affected areas is given an opportunity to enter into an agreement with the division, agreeing that in exchange for a certain sum of money per acre of irrigated land serviced by the irrigation system, the permittee will not irrigate those particular acres for the remainder of that calendar year. The authority shall pay the sum so agreed upon when so directed by the director from the unexpended balance of the drought protection funds. In conducting the irrigation reduction auction, the division may establish a maximum dollar amount per acre to be expended from the drought protection funds for such purposes.

     <p>
      If the director determines that the total number of nonirrigated acres needed during a given year cannot be sufficiently obtained through the irrigation reduction auction held in accordance with Code Section 12-5-546, the director is authorized to issue an order, in accordance with rules adopted by the board, requiring certain permittees not to irrigate a specified number of acres of irrigated land until the end of the calendar year. When issuing such orders, the director shall begin with the permittees whose withdrawal permits were issued most recently and then work chronologically backward with each order issued. A permittee who is issued such an order shall be compensated for such restriction if such permittee applied to the division for a surface-water or ground-water withdrawal permit prior to December 1, 1999, received a surface-water or ground-water withdrawal permit from the division prior to December 1, 2000, and is able to demonstrate actual previous irrigation on the same acres of land which the owner has been ordered not to irrigate. The per acre dollar amount received by a permittee pursuant to this Code section shall be equal to the average agreed upon sum per acre paid pursuant to the irrigation reduction auction during the same year.

       The General Assembly finds that 433,000 acres of trees were planted in Georgia in 1984, while 640,000 acres were harvested during that year for a net loss of over 200,000 planted acres. The General Assembly further finds that the forest industry is of fundamental importance to the economy of the State of Georgia and that increased reforestation is necessary to meet future demands for forest products and to promote economic development and additional employment opportunities within this state. The General Assembly further finds that many acres of farm land and other open land in Georgia are not currently being used to the best advantage and that a program to provide incentives to encourage reforestation on these lands would be of great benefit to the people of Georgia. The General Assembly further finds that increased reforestation would substantially reduce soil erosion, which continues to be a serious problem in Georgia, and would be of other value in preserving and protecting wildlife and other natural resources of this state. It is determined, therefore, that it is in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare and would serve an important public purpose for the State Forestry Commission to establish a reforestation incentives program for the State of Georgia.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any fire burning uncontrolled on any forested or cut-over brush land or grassland is declared to be a public nuisance by reason of its menace to life and property. Any person, firm, or corporation responsible either for the starting or for the existence of such fire is required to control or extinguish it immediately. If such person, firm, or corporation shall refuse or neglect to do so, any organized fire suppression force may suppress the nuisance thus constituted by controlling and extinguishing the fire; and the cost thereof may be recovered from the responsible person, firm, or corporation.

       Entry onto land to fight fire requires no commission authority.

       Landowner's knowledge of unauthorized entry suggested as safety measure.

       Conditions for grant of license by reciprocity.
       
       - Under this section the granting of a license by reciprocity has no relation to the state in which the licensee resides; the only question for consideration when a licensee from another state has made application for registration in this state is whether or not the state in which the licensee is licensed permits "licensing of foresters registered in Georgia on terms substantially equivalent to those of this section." 1958-59 Op.

      The General Assembly, recognizing that the forest lands and resources of the state are a natural resource of great economic value to the citizens of the state, comprising two-thirds of the state's area, or 24 million acres, and giving employment to over 177,000 Georgia citizens and bringing to the state a $19.5 billion economic impact; that uncontrolled forest fires threaten not only lands on which they occur, but also the health of the lands and the citizens of the state; that the present and potential production of forest products are materially menaced and reduced through recurring uncontrolled forest fires, thereby resulting in loss to owners of forest lands, industries, workers, and communities; that it is of vital importance to the state to protect and develop forest lands for the continuous production of forest products; and that this cannot be accomplished without organized and coordinated state-wide protection, declares that protection against uncontrolled fire and preservation of the forest lands and forest resources of the state are essential for the economic welfare of the state and its people and further declares that prescribed burning is an effective method of reducing fuel loads and the potential hazards and impact associated with uncontrolled fires.

       is twofold, to-wit: (1) to permit the State Forestry Commission, through the Commission's communication and weather reporting facilities, to advise the landowner as to whether or not conditions are safe for burning, and to mobilize the Commission's equipment on a standby basis; and (2) to prevent the State Forestry Commission, upon spotting unreported smoke in any part of the county, from sending out valuable equipment to investigate, only to discover a controlled fire, thereby avoiding serious expense by giving notice of the controlled burning. 1954-56 Op.

       It is declared by the General Assembly that prescribed burning is a resource protection and land management tool which benefits the safety of the public, Georgia's forest resources, the environment, and the economy of the state. The General Assembly finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t12c06a01p06s12-6-146ol1a1">
         Prescribed burning reduces naturally occurring vegetative fuels within forested areas. Reduction of such fuels by burning reduces the risk and severity of major wildfire, thereby lessening the threat of fire and the resulting loss of life and property;
        </li>
        <li id="t12c06a01p06s12-6-146ol1a2">
         Georgia's ever-increasing population situates urban development directly adjacent to fire prone forest lands. The use of prescribed fire to manage fuels in interface areas would substantially reduce the threat of damaging wildfire in urban communities;
        </li>
        <li id="t12c06a01p06s12-6-146ol1a3">
         Forest land constitutes significant economic, biological, and aesthetic resources of state-wide importance. Prescribed burning on forest land serves to reduce hazardous accumulations of fuels, prepare sites for both natural and artificial forest regeneration, improve wildlife habitat, control insects and disease, and perpetuate fire dependent ecosystems;
        </li>
        <li id="t12c06a01p06s12-6-146ol1a4">
         State and federally owned public use lands such as state parks, state and national forests, and wildlife refuges receive resource enhancement through use of prescribed burning;
        </li>
        <li id="t12c06a01p06s12-6-146ol1a5">
         As Georgia's population continues to grow, pressures from liability issues and smoke nuisance complaints cause prescribed burn practitioners to limit prescribed burn activity, thus reducing the above-mentioned benefits to the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t12c06a01p06s12-6-146ol1a6">
         Public misunderstanding of the benefit of prescribed burning to the ecological and economic welfare of the state exerts unusual pressures that prevent uninhibited use of this valuable forest resource management tool; and
        </li>
        <li id="t12c06a01p06s12-6-146ol1a7">
         Fire benefits rare, threatened, and endangered plants, deer, turkey, quail, dove, and other game as well as numerous songbirds and other nongame species by the increased growth and yields of herbs and legumes. It also allows openings for feeding and travel.

       The General Assembly finds that certain real property in Georgia, because it exhibits unique natural characteristics, special historical significance, or particular recreational value, constitutes a valuable heritage which should be protected to provide benefits to all Georgians, now and in the future. The General Assembly specifically recognizes that the forest lands and resources of the state are a natural resource of great economic value to the citizens of the state, not only for the potential production of forest products which they can provide, but also for the enormously valuable natural benefits they impart to the citizens of Georgia, such as air and water quality improvements, water storage, control of erosion, temperature moderation, habitat for native plants and wildlife, and opportunities for recreation in a natural, historic Georgia environment. Natural forested lands also allow present and future citizens to gain an understanding of the prehistoric and early culture of this region. Commercial forests provide traditional jobs, support our economy, and reflect the importance this industry has had in the development of Georgia. The General Assembly further finds that many of the forest resources of the state are under pressure to be converted to other uses because of Georgia's rapid progress and increased population over the past decades. As forest lands are converted to other uses and irreparably altered, a valuable part of our cultural heritage is lost as well as the natural benefits those forest lands provide.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c06a06s12-6-241ol1b">
       The General Assembly declares, therefore, that there is a compelling public need to preserve forest lands as an element of Georgia's heritage. The General Assembly asserts the public interest in the state's heritage by creating the Forest Heritage Trust Program, which shall be the responsibility of the Governor and the State Forestry Commission and which shall seek to protect this heritage through the acquisition of fee simple title or lesser interests in valuable properties and by utilization of other available methods.

       12-7-2. Legislative findings; policy of state and intent of chapter.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is found that soil erosion and sediment deposition onto lands and into waters within the watersheds of this state are occurring as a result of widespread failure to apply proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities and that such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of state waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resource uses. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state and the intent of this chapter to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities and programs of this state and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a state-wide comprehensive soil erosion and sediment control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air, and other resources of this state.

       - Trial court erred by concluding that an organization had standing to appeal a consent order between a property owner and the Director of the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) with regard to soil erosion as it lacked standing to appeal based upon its inability to demonstrate redressability as it failed to identify a procedural requirement the EPD violated, and the consent order did not fall within the categories of orders that required provision of notice and opportunity for comment.

      Process of acquiring a permit for the operation of a sanitary landfill
     </b>
     in Georgia begins with an application to the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the State Department of Natural Resources for a letter of acceptance signifying the geological suitability of the tract in question for operation of a sanitary landfill. The second step on the state level requires an application for a permit signifying that the specific plan for operation of the landfill meets the requirements of state law. One such requirement is a letter from the proper local governing body assuring the EPD that the operation of a sanitary landfill on that particular tract will comply with local zoning regulations.

      <li id="t12c08a02p01s12-8-21ol1a">
       It is declared to be the policy of the State of Georgia, in furtherance of its responsibility to protect the public health, safety, and well-being of its citizens and to protect and enhance the quality of its environment, to institute and maintain a comprehensive state-wide program for solid waste management and to prevent and abate litter, so as to assure that solid waste does not adversely affect the health, safety, and well-being of the public and that solid waste facilities, whether publicly or privately owned, do not degrade the quality of the environment by reason of their location, design, method of operation, or other means and which, to the extent feasible and practical, makes maximum utilization of the resources contained in solid waste.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c08a02p01s12-8-21ol1b">
       It is further declared to be the policy of the State of Georgia to educate and encourage generators and handlers of solid waste to reduce and minimize to the greatest extent possible the amount of solid waste which requires collection, treatment, or disposal through source reduction, reuse, composting, recycling, and other methods and to promote markets for and engage in the purchase of goods made from recovered materials and goods which are recyclable.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c08a02p01s12-8-21ol1c">
       It is the intent of the General Assembly that every effort be undertaken to reduce on a state-wide per capita basis the amount of municipal solid waste being received at disposal facilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c08a02p01s12-8-21ol1d">
       It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources shall be the official charged with primary responsibility for the solid waste management program.  The director, in exercising any authority granted in this part, shall conform to and implement the policies outlined in this part and shall at all times coordinate his activities with those of other state agencies and local political jurisdictions so as to achieve a unified and effective solid waste management program in the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c08a02p01s12-8-21ol1e">
       It is further intended by the General Assembly that the director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources shall, in exercising any authority granted in this part, recognize that the states which share common borders with Georgia also share the vital natural resources of clean air, clean surface waters, and clean ground waters which flow across those common borders and that, therefore, those bordering states have a mutual interest with Georgia to manage solid waste in a manner that does not threaten to contaminate the shared natural resources.  The director shall also recognize, however, that such mutual interest may not exist between Georgia and states which do not share common borders and natural resources with it. Therefore, the director is instructed to be particularly mindful of the need to monitor, inspect, and regulate closely that solid waste generated from sources located in states not sharing common borders and natural resources with Georgia.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c08a02p01s12-8-21ol1f">
       It is further the intent of the General Assembly that every effort be undertaken to ensure the proper management of scrap tires from the point of generation to the ultimate point of reuse, recycling, or disposal and that every effort be made to ensure that, where possible, they be reused or recycled rather than being disposed.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c08a02p01s12-8-21ol1g">
       It is further the intent of the General Assembly to provide a frame of reference for this state and all counties, municipal corporations, and solid waste management authorities in this state relating to the handling of yard trimmings. It is also the intent of the General Assembly to encourage beneficial reuse of yard trimmings and other vegetative matter by composting and other methods of recycling and return of such vegetative matter to the soil and by reuse of yard trimmings to promote bioenergy and renewable energy goals. The General Assembly, therefore, adopts and recommends the following hierarchy for handling yard trimmings:

       Ordinance restricting waste disposal services upheld.
       
       - Georgia trial court erred by denying injunctive relief to a county and the county's chosen waste disposal company wherein it sought to prohibit an unauthorized waste company from providing services in the county against an ordinance because the ordinance served a legitimate public purpose by establishing means reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the county providing a comprehensive solid waste management plan as the county was required to do under O.C.G.A.

        Direct appeal from denial of mandamus to compel verification.
       </b>
       - Intermediate court properly transferred an application for discretionary review filed by a limited liability limited partnership (LLLP), seeking review of the denial of the partnership's request for a writ of mandamus, to the Georgia Supreme Court, as cases involving the grant or denial of mandamus are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Georgia Supreme Court without regard to the underlying subject matter or the legal issues raised. As the case involved permitting requirements for landfills, it concerned a statutory scheme requiring a permit from the state for a land use that was regulated by the state, and the LLLP was entitled to a direct appeal from the denial of its mandamus action.

       As provided for in Code Section 12-8-21, it is the policy of the State of Georgia to assure that solid waste facilities do not adversely affect the health, safety, and well-being of the public and do not degrade the quality of the environment. The General Assembly finds that an excessive concentration of solid waste facilities in any one community can adversely affect the health, safety, well-being, and environment of that community and impose an onus on the community without any reciprocal benefits to the community. The purpose of this Code section is to provide a limited degree of protection against any given community becoming an involuntary host to an excessive concentration of solid waste facilities.

       Unless variances are prohibited by the federal act or the standards, rules, and regulations promulgated thereunder, the director may grant variances from the requirements of this article or the rules and regulations effective under this article whenever the director finds that compliance with any provision of this article or any standard, rule, or regulation will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property or will result, in effect, in the closing and elimination of any lawful business, occupation, or activity without sufficient corresponding benefit or advantage to the public, provided that no variance shall be granted where the effect of a variance will permit the continuation of a condition which poses an undue present or potential threat to the environment or to the health of humans; provided, further, that any variance so granted shall not be construed so as to relieve any person from any liability imposed by law or rule and regulation.

       As a condition precedent to the issuance of a variance, the director may require the filing of a bond in accordance with Code Section 12-8-68, sufficient to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the variance. The director may require that the bond shall remain in effect until all terms and conditions of the variance are met and compliance is achieved with this article and the rules and regulations promulgated under this article.

       Upon failure of a person to comply with the terms and conditions of any bond or any variance issued by the director, a variance may be amended, modified, suspended, or revoked, or the bond may be forfeited by the director or ordered to be modified or amended. The proceeds from any forfeited bond shall be deposited in either the hazardous waste facility trust fund in accordance with Code Section 12-8-68 or the hazardous waste trust fund in accordance with Code Section 12-8-91, as the director deems appropriate.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the director, upon receipt of evidence that the past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste is presenting or may present imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment or to the health of humans, may bring an action as provided in Code Section 12-8-72 to restrain immediately any person, including any past or present generator, past or present transporter, or past or present owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, who has caused or is causing or has contributed or is contributing to such handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal to stop such handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal or to take such other action as may be necessary.
      If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the environment or the health of humans solely by commencement of such a civil action, the director, with the concurrence of the Governor, may issue such emergency orders as may be necessary to protect the environment or the health of humans who are or may be affected by such past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal. Notwithstanding Code Sections 12-8-71, 12-8-72, 12-8-73, 12-8-74, 12-8-81, and 12-8-96, such order shall be immediately effective for a period of not more than 48 hours unless the director brings an action under the first sentence of this Code section before the expiration of such period.
      Whenever the director brings such an action within such period, such order shall be effective for such period of time as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter.

       Each and every person who contributed to a release of a hazardous waste, a hazardous constituent, or a hazardous substance shall be jointly, severally, and strictly liable to the State of Georgia for the reasonable costs of activities associated with the cleanup of environmental hazards, including legal expenses incurred by the state pursuant to subsection (a) of Code Section 12-8-96, as a result of the failure of such person to comply with an order issued by the director. Any such person shall be so liable notwithstanding the absence of the issuance of an order to such person pursuant to subsection (a) of Code Section 12-8-96 if the director is unable to identify such person prior to the commencement of clean-up action after making a reasonable effort to do so pursuant to such Code section, or if such person contributed to a release which resulted in an emergency action by the director and issuance of such an order would cause a delay in corrective action that could endanger human health and the environment. The person may, in addition, be liable for punitive damages in an amount at least equal to the costs incurred by the state and not more than three times the costs incurred by the state for activities associated with the cleanup of environmental hazards. Costs and damages incurred by the state may be recovered in a civil action instituted in the name of the director. All costs recovered by the state pursuant to this Code section shall be deposited into the hazardous waste trust fund.

       No person shall be liable for costs or damages pursuant to this Code section if he can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the release of a hazardous waste, a hazardous constituent, or a hazardous substance was caused solely by:

Nothing in this subsection shall affect the liability under this part of a person who, by any act or omission, causes or contributes to the disposal or release of a hazardous waste, a hazardous constituent, or a hazardous substance which is the subject of the action relating to the site.

Such claims for contribution shall be governed by the law of this state.  In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines to be appropriate.  In any action filed by the director for the recovery of costs and damages pursuant to this Code section, any third-party claim for contribution may, upon the motion of the director, be severed and maintained as a separate action.

The voluntary investigation and remediation plan shall be in such streamlined form as may be prescribed by the director; provided, however, that the plan shall, at minimum, enumerate and describe those actions planned to bring the qualifying property into compliance with the applicable cleanup standards, with one or more registered professionals to be retained by the applicant at its sole cost to oversee the investigation and remediation described in the plan; all in accordance with the provisions, purposes, standards, and policies of the voluntary remediation program. The voluntary investigation and remediation plan shall be considered an application for enrollment in the voluntary remediation program, and a nonrefundable application fee of $5,000.00 shall be submitted with the application. The director may, at any time, invoice the participant for any costs to the division in reviewing the application or subsequent document that exceed the initial application review fee, including reasonably detailed itemization and justification of the costs. Failure to remit payment within 60 days of receipt of such invoice may cause rejection of the participant from the voluntary remediation program.

      'ARTICLE I. POLICY AND PURPOSE
      
     </p>
     
     <p>
      There is hereby created the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact. The party states recognize and declare that each state is responsible for providing for availability of capacity either within or outside the state for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders, except for waste generated as a result of defense activities of the federal government or federal research and development activities. They also recognize that the management of low-level radioactive waste is handled most efficiently on a regional basis. The party states further recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (P.L. 96-573), has provided for and encouraged the development of low-level radioactive waste compacts as a tool for disposal of such waste. The party states recognize that the safe and efficient management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to dispose of such waste be properly provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the policy of the party states to: enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste management compact for the purpose of providing the instrument and framework for a cooperative effort; provide sufficient facilities for the proper management of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, promote the health and safety of the region; limit the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive waste generated in the region; encourage the reduction of the amounts of low-level waste generated in the region; distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of successful low-level radioactive waste management equitably among the party states; and ensure the ecological and economical management of low-level radioactive wastes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Implicit in the Congressional consent to this Compact is the expectation by the Congress and the party states that the appropriate federal agencies will actively assist the Compact Commission and the individual party states to this Compact by:

       RTICLE III. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
       
      </h4>
      
      <p>
       The rights granted to the party states by this Compact are additional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and nothing in this Compact shall be construed to infringe upon, limit, or abridge those rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       a.
       Subject to any license issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or a host state, each party state shall have the right to have all wastes generated within its borders stored, treated, or disposed of, as applicable, at regional facilities, and additionally shall have the right of access to facilities made available to the region through agreements entered into by the Commission pursuant to Article IV(e)(9). The right of access by a generator within a party state to any regional facility is limited by its adherence to applicable state and federal law and regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       b.
       If no operating regional facility is located within the borders of a party state and the waste generated within its borders must therefore be stored, treated, or disposed of at a regional facility in another state, the party state without such facilities may be required by the host state or states to establish a mechanism which provides compensation for access to the regional facility according to terms and conditions established by the host state or states and approved by a two-thirds vote of the commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       c.
       Each party state must establish the capability to regulate, license, and ensure the maintenance and extended care of any facility within its borders. Host states are responsible for the availability, the subsequent post-closure observation and maintenance, and the extended institutional control of their regional facilities, in accordance with the provisions of Article V, Section b.
      </p>
      <p>
       d.
       Each party state must establish the capability to enforce any applicable federal or state laws and regulations pertaining to the packaging and transportation of waste generated within or passing through its borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.
       Each party state must provide to the Commission on an annual basis, any data and information necessary to the implementation of the Commission's responsibilities. Each party state shall establish the capability to obtain any data and information necessary to meet its obligation herein defined.
      </p>
      <p>
       f.
       Each party state must, to the extent authorized by federal law, require generators within its borders to use the best available waste management technologies and practices to minimize the volumes of wastes requiring disposal.

      </p>
      <p>
       b.
       Each Commission member is entitled to one vote. No action of the Commission shall be binding unless a majority of the total membership cast their vote in the affirmative, or unless a greater than majority vote is specifically required by any other provision of this Compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       c.
       The Commission must elect from among its members a presiding officer. The Commission shall adopt and publish, in convenient form, by-laws which are consistent with this Compact.

      </p>
      <p>
       e.
       The Commission has the following duties and powers:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t12c08a05s12-8-122IVol11">
        to receive and approve the application of a non-party state to become an eligible state in accordance with the provisions of Article VII(b); and,
       </li>

        to develop and use procedures for determining, consistent with considerations for public health and safety, the type and number of regional facilities which are presently necessary and which are projected to be necessary to manage waste generated within the region; and
       </li>
       <li id="t12c08a05s12-8-122IVol15">
        to provide the party states with reference guidelines for establishing the criteria and procedures for evaluating alternative locations for emergency or permanent regional facilities; and
       </li>
       <li id="t12c08a05s12-8-122IVol16">
        to develop and adopt, within one year after the Commission is constituted as provided in Article VII, Section d., procedures and criteria for identifying a party state as a host state for a regional facility as determined pursuant to the requirements of this Article. In accordance with these procedures and criteria, the Commission shall identify a host state for the development of a second regional disposal facility within three years after the Commission is constituted as provided for in Article VII, Section d. and shall seek to ensure that such facility is licensed and ready to operate as soon as required but in no event later than 1991.
        <p>
         In developing criteria, the Commission must consider the following: the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the party states; the existence of regional facilities within each party state; the minimization of waste transportation; the volumes and types of wastes generated within each party state; and the environmental, economic, and ecological impacts on the air, land and water resources of the party states.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Commission shall conduct such hearings, require such reports, studies, evidence, and testimony, and do what is required by its approved procedures in order to identify a party state as a host state for a needed regional facility; and

       <li id="t12c08a05s12-8-122IVol17">
        in accordance with the procedures and criteria developed pursuant to section (e)(6) of this Article, to designate, by a two-thirds vote, a host state for the establishment of a needed regional facility. The Commission shall not exercise this authority unless the party states have failed to voluntarily pursue the development of such facility. The Commission shall have the authority to revoke the membership of a party state that willfully creates barriers to the siting of a needed regional facility; and
       </li>
       <li id="t12c08a05s12-8-122IVol18">
        to require of and obtain from party states, eligible states seeking to become party states, and non-party states seeking to become eligible states, data and information necessary to the implementation of Commission responsibilities; and

        notwithstanding any other provision of this Compact, to enter into agreements with any person, state, or similar regional body or group of states for the importation of waste into the region and for the right of access to facilities outside the region for waste generated within the region. The authorization to import requires a two-thirds majority vote of the Commission, including an affirmative vote of both representatives of the host state in which any affected regional facility is located. This shall be done only after an assessment of the affected facilities' capability to handle such wastes; and
       </li>
       <li id="t12c08a05s12-8-122IVol110">
        to act or appear on behalf of any party state or states, only upon written request of both members of the Commission for such state or states, as an intervenor or party in interest before Congress, state legislatures, any court of law, or any federal, state, or local agency, board, or commission which has jurisdiction over the management of wastes. The authority to act, intervene, or otherwise appear shall be exercised by the Commission, only after approval by a majority vote of the Commission; and

       <li id="t12c08a05s12-8-122IVol1c">
        must be paid to the Commission, provided, however, that each host state collecting such fees or surcharges may retain a portion of the collection sufficient to cover its administrative costs of collection, and that the remainder be sufficient only to cover the approved annual budgets of the Commission.
        <p>
         3. The Commission must set and approve its first annual budget as soon as practicable after its initial meeting. Host states for disposal facilities must begin imposition of the special fees and surcharges provided for in this section as soon as practicable after becoming party states, and must remit to the Commission funds resulting from collection of such special fees and surcharges within 60 days of their receipt.

The nature, amount, and condition, if any, attendant upon any donation or grant accepted pursuant to this paragraph, together with the identity of the donor, grantor, or lender, shall be detailed in the annual report of the Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         k.
         The Commission is not responsible for any costs associated with (1) the creation of any facility, (2) the operation of any facility, (3) the stabilization and closure of any facility, (4) the post-closure observation and maintenance of any facility, or (5) the extended institutional control, after post-closure observation and maintenance of any facility.
        </p>
        <p>
         l.
         As of January 1, 1986, the management of wastes at regional facilities is restricted to wastes generated within the region, and to wastes generated within non-party states when authorized by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of this compact. After January 1, 1986, the Commission may prohibit the exportation of waste from the region for the purposes of management.
        </p>
        <p>
         m. 1.
         The Commission herein established is a legal entity separate and distinct from the party states, capable of acting in its own behalf, and is liable for its actions.

      </h4>
      <p>
       a.
       Any party state which becomes a host state in which a regional facility is operated shall not be designated by the Compact Commission as a host state for an additional regional facility until each party state has fulfilled its obligation, as determined by the Commission, to have a regional facility operated within its borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       b.
       A host state desiring to close a regional facility located within its borders may do so only after notifying the Commission in writing of its intention to do so and the reasons therefor. Such notification shall be given to the Commission at least four years prior to the intended date of closure. Notwithstanding the four year notice requirement herein provided, a host state is not prevented from closing its facility or establishing conditions of its use and operations as necessary for the protection of the health and safety of its citizens. A host state may terminate or limit access to its regional facility if it determines that Congress has materially altered the conditions of this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       c.
       Each party state designated as a host for a regional facility shall take appropriate steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and operate a facility of the designated type is filed with and issued by the appropriate authority.
      </p>

       The first three states eligible to become party states to this Compact which enact this Compact into law and appropriate the fees required by Article IV(h)(1) shall immediately, upon the appointment of their Commission members, constitute themselves as the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission, shall cause legislation to be introduced in the Congress which grants the consent of the Congress to this Compact, and shall do those things necessary to organize the Commission and implement the provisions of this Compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. All succeeding states eligible to become party states to this Compact shall be declared party states pursuant to the provisions of section c of this Article.
      </p>

       3. The consent of the Congress shall be required for full implementation of this Compact. The provisions of Article V, Section d. shall not become effective until the effective date of the import ban authorized by Article IV, Section L as approved by Congress. The Congress may by law withdraw its consent only every five years.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.
       No state which holds membership in any other regional compact for the management of low-level radioactive waste may be considered by the Compact Commission for eligible state status or party state status.
      </p>
      <p>
       f.
       Any party state which fails to comply with the provisions of this Compact or to fulfill the obligations incurred by becoming a party state to this Compact may be subject to sanctions by the Commission, including suspension of its rights under this Compact, and revocation of its status as a party state. Any sanction shall be imposed only upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Commission members. Revocation of party state status may take effect on the date of the meeting at which the Commission approves the resolution imposing such sanction, but in no event shall revocation take effect later than 90 days from the date of such meeting. Rights and obligations incurred by being declared a party state to this Compact shall continue until the effective date of the sanction imposed or as provided in the resolution of the Commission imposing the sanction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission must, as soon as practicable after the meeting at which a resolution revoking status as a party state is approved, provide written notice of the action along with a copy of the resolution to the governors, the presidents of the senates, and the speakers of the houses of representatives of the party states, as well as chairmen of the appropriate committees of the Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       g.
       Subject to the provisions of Article VII, Section h., any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a law repealing the Compact, provided that if a regional facility is located within such state, such regional facility shall remain available to the region for four years after the date the Commission receives notification in writing from the governor of such party state of the rescission of the Compact. The Commission, upon receipt of the notification, shall, as soon as practicable, provide copies of such notification to the governors, the presidents of the senates, and the speakers of the houses of representatives of the party states, as well as the chairmen of the appropriate committees of the Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       h.
       The right of a party state to withdraw pursuant to Article VII Section g. shall terminate thirty days following the commencement of operation of the second host state disposal facility. Thereafter, a party state may withdraw only with the unanimous approval of the Commission and with the consent of Congress. For purposes of this section, the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Barnwell County, South Carolina shall be considered the first host state disposal facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       i.
       This Compact may be terminated only by the affirmative action of the Congress or by the rescission of all laws enacting the Compact in each party state.

       - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C.

Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions.

       - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C.

       7401 et seq., or the state implementation plan controlled or limited CO2 emissions. Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the director, upon receipt of evidence that a source or facility or combination of sources or facilities is presenting imminent and substantial danger to the health of persons, may bring an action as provided in Code Section 12-9-12 immediately to restrain any person causing or contributing to the alleged pollution through the emission of air contaminants to stop the emission of air pollutants causing or contributing to such pollution or to take such other action as may be necessary. If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the health of persons solely by commencement of such a civil action, the director, with the concurrence of the Governor, may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the health of persons who are, or may be, affected by such pollution source or facility. Prior to issuing an order under this Code section, the director shall consult with local authorities in order to confirm the correctness of the information on which action proposed to be taken is based and to ascertain the action which such authorities are or will be taking. Notwithstanding Code Sections 12-9-12, 12-9-13, and 12-9-15, such order shall be immediately effective for a period of not more than 24 hours unless the director brings an action under the first sentence of this Code section before the expiration of such period. Whenever the director brings such an action within such period, such order shall be effective for a period of 48 hours or such longer period as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter.

        Judicial review of air quality permit.
       </b>
       - Trial court decision invalidating an air quality permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to a power company to construct a pulverized coal-fired electric power plant in a particular county contained an erroneous ruling that the permit was invalid because the permit failed to include a limit on the power plant's carbon dioxide gas (CO2) emissions since no provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       7401 et seq., or the state implementation plan controlled or limited CO2 emissions. Because CO2 was not a pollutant that "otherwise is subject to regulation under the CAA," CO2 was not a regulated new source review pollutant in the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and was not required to be controlled by use of best available control technology (BACT), therefore, the trial court erred by ruling that the PSD permit was required to include a BACT emission limit to control the power company's CO2 emissions.

         Any source referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection which has been granted an exemption, extension, or suspension under subsection (f) of this Code section or which is covered by a consent order or decree, if such source is not in compliance with any interim emission control requirement or schedule of compliance established under such exemption, extension, suspension, or consent order or decree.

In any instance of noncompliance where a calculation by the division is necessary under this subsection, any person to whom notice was given under subsection (b) of this Code section shall make available to division personnel, and allow division personnel and disinterested parties contracted with under this subsection to have access to such financial, operational, and maintenance records as shall be necessary to complete computations under subsection (d) of this Code section. Any such availability or access shall be at a reasonable time and place. The amount of the penalty and payment schedule determined pursuant to a contract entered into by the director under this subsection shall be final and shall be considered as and given the effect of a submittal by such person pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section. The director may issue an assessment pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section based upon the determined amount and schedule and may add to the penalty, as an additional assessment, the cost of carrying out such contract.

       12-9-41. Legislative findings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      With respect to the ambient air quality in this state, the General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t12c09a02s12-9-41ol11">
       Some counties of the state have ambient air levels of ozone or carbon monoxide in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for such pollutants specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 7401, et seq., as amended; and that the USEPA has determined that under certain conditions, such excess levels in such counties are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such counties;
      </li>
      <li id="t12c09a02s12-9-41ol12">
       In order to comply with federal health related air standards in counties where the USEPA has determined that excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles, it is necessary to monitor and limit emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered  in such counties;
      </li>
      <li id="t12c09a02s12-9-41ol13">
       The USEPA has the duty, by law, to designate those areas of the state violating the NAAQS and has and will, from time to time, as facts dictate, designate those counties or areas of the state violating the NAAQS for ozone and carbon monoxide, and the USEPA has the duty, by law, to establish criteria to determine whether the excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles in such counties;
      </li>
      <li id="t12c09a02s12-9-41ol14">
       With respect to such designations, when counties or areas are designated to have ambient air levels of pollutants in excess of the NAAQS and according to the criteria established by the USEPA the excess levels of pollution are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles, the state is under a duty to provide a plan for reducing the ambient air levels of pollutants found to be in excess of the NAAQS if the state is to maintain its authority to permit new or expanded industry in such county or area; and
      </li>
      <li id="t12c09a02s12-9-41ol15">
       Failure of the state to provide a legally enforceable mechanism pursuant to state law for reducing such pollutants in such counties or areas to levels within the NAAQS will result in such a mechanism subsequently being devised by USEPA and enforced in such areas pursuant to federal law and could result in a significant loss of federal funds for sewage treatment plants, transportation projects, and air quality improvement funds; further,  new or expanded industry which would contribute to the ambient air level of such pollutants would be subject to significant new emission control requirements to offset increased emissions.

      This article shall operate uniformly throughout the state. The provisions and requirements of this article shall apply in each county or any portion of a county which has been designated by the USEPA in the Code of Federal Regulations as a county or area included within a nonattainment area and which the board designates, through regulation, as a county or area where the excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, or carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such county or area. This article shall continue to apply in each such county or portion of a county so designated until the USEPA removes such county or area from the Code of Federal Regulations as a nonattainment area and approves an air quality implementation plan which allows the state to maintain the NAAQS in such county without a vehicle inspection program.

       Each responsible motor vehicle subject to any requirement under Code Section 12-9-45 must receive a certificate of emission inspection once during any inspection term from an emission inspection station holding a valid certificate of authorization from the department. A certificate of emission inspection shall be issued for such a responsible motor vehicle if, upon inspection by a licensed mechanic inspector, the mechanic inspector determines, consistent with the terms of Code Section 12-9-45, with respect to such responsible motor vehicle:

        <li id="t12c09a02s12-9-48ol1i1">
         Any approved emission inspection station may issue said duplicate certification of emission inspection upon the owner's demonstrating to the mechanic inspector that the responsible motor vehicle has a current and valid inspection sticker affixed to its window;

         The director shall issue said duplicate certification of emission inspection upon the owner's demonstrating to the director that said vehicle had been inspected previously and bears a current and valid inspection sticker; or
        </li>
        <li id="t12c09a02s12-9-48ol1i3">
         In the event a windshield bearing a valid emission inspection sticker is replaced, a new emission inspection sticker may be issued for such vehicle within 30 days after the replacement of the windshield without the necessity of reinspection if the owner of the vehicle executes an affidavit in a form furnished by the director stating that the windshield of his or her vehicle has been replaced and giving such other information as the director may require and pays to the inspection station a fee in an amount equal to the actual administrative cost of issuing such a sticker which shall be no less than the cost of the sticker plus the cost of computer access. The vehicle may be operated on the highways without an emission inspection sticker for 30 days after the replacement of the windshield if proof of the date of such replacement is carried in the vehicle.
         <p>
          In all cases, the new emission inspection sticker or duplicate certificate of emission inspection shall be valid only for the remainder of the period for which the replaced emission inspection sticker or certificate of emission inspection was to be valid.

       The director of the Environmental Protection Division of the department is authorized and urged to study and review the use of gasoline additives in this state and to develop rules and regulations not later than January 1, 2008, for consideration by the Board of Natural Resources to provide for a phase out of the permissible use of gasoline containing MTBE in a manner designed to coordinate such phase out with other states adjacent to this state to the extent practicable; and the board is authorized to adopt rules and regulations for such purpose. In developing such rules and regulations, the director is urged to consider the need to ensure adequate supplies of gasoline in this state, environmental issues such as air quality and ground-water protection, the overall benefits and concerns with various gasoline additives, the use of additives by adjacent states, and the viability of ethanol for use as an additive to the greatest extent practicable.

     - Ga. L. 1979, p. 806 changed the name of the Southern Interstate Nuclear Compact to the Southern States Energy Compact and made several other changes in the text of the Compact and in this article. Ga. L. 1979, p. 806,

     9 were to become effective "at such time as nine of the party states to the Southern Interstate Nuclear Compact approve substantially the same changes in the Compact as are provided for in this Act and the Congress of the United States consents to the Compact, substantially as amended by this Act." Subsequently, the Compact received the approval of the requisite number of states and by the Congress of the United States; thus, the Act is now binding.

     </p>
     <p>
      The party states recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, materials, and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the environment, can assist substantially in the industrialization of the South and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from and acquisition of energy resources and facilities require systematic encouragements, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.

        (e)
        The ACF Basin Commission shall meet at least once a year at a date set at its initial meeting. Such initial meeting shall take place within ninety days of the ratification of the Compact by the Congress of the United States and shall be called by the chairman of the Commission. Special meetings of the Commission may be called at the discretion of the chairman of the Commission and shall be called by the chairman of the Commission upon written request of any member of the Commission.

         <p>
          (a)
          It is the intent of the parties to this Compact to develop an allocation formula for equitably apportioning the surface waters of the ACF Basin among the states while protecting the water quality, ecology and biodiversity of the ACF, as provided in the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Sections 1251 et seq., the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. Sections 1532 et seq., the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 4321 et seq., the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. Sections 401 et seq., and other applicable federal laws. For this purpose, all members of the ACF Basin Commission, including the Federal Commissioner, shall have full rights to notice of and participation in all meetings of the ACF Basin Commission and technical committees in which the basis and terms and conditions of the allocation formula are to be discussed or negotiated. When an allocation formula is unanimously approved by the State Commissioners, there shall be an agreement among the states regarding an allocation formula. The allocation formula thus agreed upon shall become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact upon receipt by the Commission of a letter of concurrence with said formula from the Federal Commissioner. If, however, the Federal Commissioner fails to submit a letter of concurrence to the Commission within two hundred ten (210) days after the allocation formula is agreed upon by the State Commissioners, the Federal Commissioner shall within forty-five (45) days thereafter submit to the ACF Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence with the allocation formula setting forth therein specifically and in detail the reasons for nonconcurrence; provided, however, the reasons for nonconcurrence as contained in the letter of nonconcurrence shall be based solely upon federal law. The allocation formula shall also become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact if the Federal Commissioner fails to submit to the ACF Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence in accordance with this Article. Once adopted pursuant to this Article, the allocation formula may only be modified by unanimous decision of the State Commissioners and the concurrence by the Federal Commissioner in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          The parties to this Compact recognize that the United States operates certain projects within the ACF Basin that may influence the water resources within the ACF Basin. The parties to this Compact further acknowledge and recognize that various agencies of the United States have responsibilities for administering certain federal laws and exercising certain federal powers that may influence the water resources within the ACF Basin. It is the intent of the parties to this Compact, including the United States, to achieve compliance with the allocation formula adopted in accordance with this Article. Accordingly, once an allocation formula is adopted, each and every officer, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall have an obligation and duty, to the maximum extent practicable, to exercise their powers, authority, and discretion in a manner consistent with the allocation formula so long as the exercise of such powers, authority, and discretion is not in conflict with federal law.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c)
          Between the effective date of this Compact and the approval of the allocation formula under this Article, the signatories to this Compact agree that any person who is withdrawing, diverting, or consuming water resources of the ACF Basin as of the effective date of this Compact, may continue to withdraw, divert or consume such water resources in accordance with the laws of the state where such person resides or does business and in accordance with applicable federal laws. The parties to this Compact further agree that any such person may increase the amount of water resources withdrawn, diverted or consumed to satisfy reasonable increases in the demand of such person for water between the effective date of this Compact and the date on which an allocation formula is approved by the ACF Basin Commission as permitted by applicable law. Each of the state parties to this Compact further agree to provide written notice to each of the other parties to this Compact in the event any person increases the withdrawal, diversion or consumption of such water resources by more than 10 million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis, or in the event any person, who was not withdrawing, diverting or consuming any water resources from the ACF Basin as of the effective date of this Compact, seeks to withdraw, divert or consume more than one million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis from such resources. This Article shall not be construed as granting any permanent, vested or perpetual rights to the amounts of water used between January 3, 1992 and the date on which the Commission adopts an allocation formula.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d)
          As the owner, operator, licensor, permitting authority or regulator of a water resource facility under its jurisdiction, each state shall be responsible for using its best efforts to achieve compliance with the allocation formula adopted pursuant to this Article. Each such state agrees to take such actions as may be necessary to achieve compliance with the allocation formula.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e)
          This Compact shall not commit any state to agree to any data generated by any study or commit any state to any allocation formula not acceptable to such state.
         </p>
         <p>
          (a)
          This Compact shall be terminated and thereby be void and of no further force and effect if any of the following events occur:
         </p>
         <p>
          (1) The legislatures of the states of Alabama, Florida and Georgia each agree by general laws enacted by each state within any three consecutive years that this Compact should be terminated.
         </p>
         <p>
          (2) The United States Congress enacts a law expressly repealing this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          (3) The States of Alabama, Florida and Georgia fail to agree on an equitable apportionment of the surface waters of the ACF as provided in Article VII(a) of this Compact by December 31, 1998, unless the voting members of the ACF Basin Commission unanimously agree to extend this deadline.
         </p>
         <p>
          (4) The Federal Commissioner submits to the Commission a letter of nonconcurrence in the initial allocation formula in accordance with Article VII(a) of the Compact, unless the voting members of the ACF Basin Commission unanimously agree to allow a single 45 day period in which the non-voting Federal Commissioner and the voting State Commissioners may renegotiate an allocation formula and the Federal Commissioner withdraws the letter of nonconcurrence upon completion of this renegotiation.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          If the Compact is terminated in accordance with this Article it shall be of no further force and effect and shall not be the subject of any proceeding for the enforcement thereof in any federal or state court. Further, if so terminated, no party shall be deemed to have acquired a specific right to any quantity of water because it has become a signatory to this Compact.

         <p>
          The ACF Basin Commission, in conjunction with one or more interstate, federal, state or local agencies, is hereby authorized to participate in any study in process as of the effective date of this Compact, including, without limitation, all or any part of the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa/Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin Comprehensive Water Resource Study, as may be determined by the Commission in its sole discretion.

         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          Nothing contained in this Compact shall be deemed to restrict the executive powers of the President in the event of a national emergency.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c)
          Nothing contained in this Compact shall impair or affect the constitutional authority of the United States or any of its powers, rights, functions or jurisdiction under other existing or future laws in and over the area or waters which are the subject of the Compact, including projects of the Commission, nor shall any act of the Commission have the effect of repealing, modifying or amending any federal law. All officers, agencies and instrumentalities of the United States shall exercise their powers and authority over water resources in the ACF Basin and water resource facilities, and to the maximum extent practicable, shall exercise their discretion in carrying out their responsibilities, powers, and authorities over water resources in the ACF Basin and water resource facilities in the ACF Basin in a manner consistent with and that effectuates the allocation formula developed pursuant to this Compact or any modification of the allocation formula so long as the actions are not in conflict with any applicable federal law. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, or its successors, and all other federal agencies and instrumentalities shall cooperate with the ACF Basin Commission in accomplishing the purposes of the Compact and fulfilling the obligations of each of the parties to the Compact regarding the allocation formula.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d)
          Once adopted by the three states and ratified by the United States Congress, this Compact shall have the full force and effect of federal law, and shall supersede state and local laws operating contrary to the provisions herein or the purposes of this Compact; provided, however, nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective signatory states relating to water quality, and riparian rights as among persons exclusively within each state.
         </p>
         <p>
          All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public. The signatory parties recognize the importance and necessity of public participation in activities of the Commission, including the development and adoption of the initial allocation formula and any modification thereto. Prior to the adoption of the initial allocation formula, the Commission shall adopt procedures ensuring public participation in the development, review, and approval of the initial allocation formula and any subsequent modification thereto. At a minimum, public notice to interested parties and a comment period shall be provided. The Commission shall respond in writing to relevant comments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commissioners shall serve without compensation from the ACF Basin Commission. All general operational funding required by the Commission and agreed to by the voting members shall obligate each state to pay an equal share of such agreed upon funding. Funds remitted to the Commission by a state in payment of such obligation shall not lapse; provided, however, that if any state fails to remit payment within 90 days after payment is due, such obligation shall terminate and any state which has made payment may have such payment returned. Costs of attendance and participation at meetings of the Commission by the Federal Commissioner shall be paid by the United States.
         </p>
         <p>
          (a)
          In the event of a dispute between two or more voting members of this Compact involving a claim relating to compliance with the allocation formula adopted by the Commission under this Compact, the following procedures shall govern:
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          (3) Upon receipt of a claim and any response or responses thereto, the Commission shall convene as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) days from receipt of any response to the claim, and shall determine if a resolution of the dispute is possible.
         </p>
         <p>
          (4) A resolution of a dispute under this Article through unanimous vote of the State Commissioners shall be binding upon the state parties and any state party determined to be in violation of the allocation formula shall correct such violation without delay.

         <p>
          (5) If the Commission is unable to resolve the dispute within 10 days from the date of the meeting convened pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this Article, the Commission shall select, by unanimous decision of the voting members of the Commission, an independent mediator to conduct a non-binding mediation of the dispute. The mediator shall not be a resident or domiciliary of any member state, shall not be an employee or agent of any member of the Commission, shall be a person knowledgeable in water resource management issues, and shall disclose any and all current or prior contractual or other relations to any member of the Commission. The expenses of the mediator shall be paid by the Commission. If the mediator becomes unwilling or unable to serve, the Commission by unanimous decision of the voting members of the Commission, shall appoint another independent mediator.
         </p>
         <p>
          (6) If the Commission fails to appoint an independent mediator to conduct a non-binding mediation of the dispute within seventy-five (75) days of the filing of the original claim or within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Commission learns that a mediator is unwilling or unable to serve, the party submitting the claim shall have no further obligation to bring the claim before the Commission and may proceed by pursuing any appropriate remedies, including any and all judicial remedies.
         </p>
         <p>
          (7) If an independent mediator is selected, the mediator shall establish the time and location for the mediation session or sessions and may request that each party to the Compact submit, in writing, to the mediator a statement of its position regarding the issue or issues in dispute. Such statements shall not be exchanged by the parties except upon the unanimous agreement of the parties to the mediation.
         </p>
         <p>
          (8) The mediator shall not divulge confidential information disclosed to the mediator by the parties or by witnesses, if any, in the course of the mediation. All records, reports, or other documents received by a mediator while serving as a mediator shall be considered confidential. The mediator shall not be compelled in any adversary proceeding or judicial forum to divulge the contents of such documents or the fact that such documents exist or to testify in regard to the mediation.

Any party to the dispute may terminate the mediation process at any time by giving written notification to the mediator and the Commission. If terminated prior to reaching a resolution, the party submitting the original claim to the Commission shall have no further obligation to bring its claim before the Commission and may proceed by pursuing any appropriate remedies, including any and all judicial remedies.
         </p>
         <p>
          (11) The mediator shall have no authority to require the parties to enter into a settlement of any dispute regarding the Compact. The mediator may simply attempt to assist the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of their dispute. The mediator is authorized to conduct joint and separate meetings with the parties to the mediation and to make oral or written recommendations for a settlement of the dispute.
         </p>
         <p>
          (12) At any time during the mediation process, the Commission is encouraged to take whatever steps it deems necessary to assist the mediator or the parties to resolve the dispute.

         <p>
          (b)
          In the event of a dispute between any voting member and the United States relating to a state's noncompliance with the allocation formula as a result of actions or a refusal to act by officers, agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, the provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this Article (other than the provisions of subparagraph (a) (4)) shall apply.

         </p>
         <p>
          (1) The Commission shall refer the dispute to an independent hearing officer or mediator, to conduct a hearing or mediation of the dispute.

         <p>
          (3) Any action brought under this Article shall be limited to equitable relief only. This Compact shall not give rise to a cause of action for money damages.

         </p>
         <p>
          The provisions of this Compact shall not interfere with the right or power of any state to regulate the use and control of water within the boundaries of the state, providing such state action is not inconsistent with the allocation formula.

         <p>
          (a)

         </p>
         <p>
          No state shall acquire any right or expectation to the use of water because of any other state's failure to use the full amount of water allocated to it under this Compact.

         <p>
          If any portion of this Compact is held invalid for any reason, the remaining portions, to the fullest extent possible, shall be severed from the void portion and given the fullest possible force, effect, and application.

         <p>
          (a)
          It is the intent of the parties to this Compact to develop an allocation formula for equitably apportioning the surface waters of the ACT Basin among the states while protecting the water quality, ecology and biodiversity of the ACT, as provided in the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Sections 1251 et seq., the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. Sections 1532 et seq., the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 4321 et seq., the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. Sections 401 et seq., and other applicable federal laws. For this purpose, all members of the ACT Basin Commission, including the Federal Commissioner, shall have full rights to notice of and participation in all meetings of the ACT Basin Commission and technical committees in which the basis and terms and conditions of the allocation formula are to be discussed or negotiated. When an allocation formula is unanimously approved by the State Commissioners, there shall be an agreement among the states regarding an allocation formula. The allocation formula thus agreed upon shall become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact upon receipt by the Commission of a letter of concurrence with said formula from the Federal Commissioner. If, however, the Federal Commissioner fails to submit a letter of concurrence to the Commission within two hundred ten (210) days after the allocation formula is agreed upon by the State Commissioners, the Federal Commissioner shall within forty-five (45) days thereafter submit to the ACT Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence with the allocation formula setting forth therein specifically and in detail the reasons for nonconcurrence; provided, however, the reasons for nonconcurrence as contained in the letter of nonconcurrence shall be based solely upon federal law. The allocation formula shall also become effective and binding upon the parties to this Compact if the Federal Commissioner fails to submit to the ACT Basin Commission a letter of nonconcurrence in accordance with this Article. Once adopted pursuant to this Article, the allocation formula may only be modified by unanimous decision of the State Commissioners and the concurrence by the Federal Commissioner in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          The parties to this Compact recognize that the United States operates certain projects within the ACT Basin that may influence the water resources within the ACT Basin. The parties to this Compact further acknowledge and recognize that various agencies of the United States have responsibilities for administering certain federal laws and exercising certain federal powers that may influence the water resources within the ACT Basin. It is the intent of the parties to this Compact, including the United States, to achieve compliance with the allocation formula adopted in accordance with this Article. Accordingly, once an allocation formula is adopted, each and every officer, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall have an obligation and duty, to the maximum extent practicable, to exercise their powers, authority, and discretion in a manner consistent with the allocation formula so long as the exercise of such powers, authority, and discretion is not in conflict with federal law.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c)
          Between the effective date of this Compact and the approval of the allocation formula under this Article, the signatories to this Compact agree that any person who is withdrawing, diverting, or consuming water resources of the ACT Basin as of the effective date of this Compact, may continue to withdraw, divert or consume such water resources in accordance with the laws of the state where such person resides or does business and in accordance with applicable federal laws. The parties to this Compact further agree that any such person may increase the amount of water resources withdrawn, diverted or consumed to satisfy reasonable increases in the demand of such person for water between the effective date of this Compact and the date on which an allocation formula is approved by the ACT Basin Commission as permitted by applicable law. Each of the state parties to this Compact further agree to provide written notice to each of the other parties to this Compact in the event any person increases the withdrawal, diversion or consumption of such water resources by more than 10 million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis, or in the event any person, who was not withdrawing, diverting or consuming any water resources from the ACT Basin as of the effective date of this Compact, seeks to withdraw, divert or consume more than one million gallons per day on an average annual daily basis from such resources. This Article shall not be construed as granting any permanent, vested or perpetual rights to the amounts of water used between January 3, 1992 and the date on which the Commission adopts an allocation formula.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d)
          As the owner, operator, licensor, permitting authority or regulator of a water resource facility under its jurisdiction, each state shall be responsible for using its best efforts to achieve compliance with the allocation formula adopted pursuant to this Article. Each such state agrees to take such actions as may be necessary to achieve compliance with the allocation formula.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e)
          This Compact shall not commit any state to agree to any data generated by any study or commit any state to any allocation formula not acceptable to such state.
         </p>
         <p>
          (a)
          This Compact shall be terminated and thereby be void and of no further force and effect if any of the following events occur:
         </p>
         <p>
          (1) The legislatures of the states of Alabama and Georgia each agree by general laws enacted by each state within any three consecutive years that this Compact should be terminated.
         </p>
         <p>
          (2) The United States Congress enacts a law expressly repealing this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          (3) The States of Alabama and Georgia fail to agree on an equitable apportionment of the surface waters of the ACT as provided in Article VII(a) of this Compact by December 31, 1998, unless the voting members of the ACT Basin Commission unanimously agree to extend this deadline.
         </p>
         <p>
          (4) The Federal Commissioner submits to the Commission a letter of nonconcurrence in the initial allocation formula in accordance with Article VII(a) of the Compact, unless the voting members of the ACT Basin Commission unanimously agree to allow a single 45 day period in which the non-voting Federal Commissioner and the voting State Commissioners may renegotiate an allocation formula and the Federal Commissioner withdraws the letter of nonconcurrence upon completion of this renegotiation.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          If the Compact is terminated in accordance with this Article it shall be of no further force and effect and shall not be the subject of any proceeding for the enforcement thereof in any federal or state court. Further, if so terminated, no party shall be deemed to have acquired a specific right to any quantity of water because it has become a signatory to this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ACT Basin Commission, in conjunction with one or more interstate, federal, state or local agencies, is hereby authorized to participate in any study in process as of the effective date of this Compact, including, without limitation, all or any part of the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa/Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin Comprehensive Water Resource Study, as may be determined by the Commission in its sole discretion.
         </p>
         <p>
          (a)
          It is the intent of the party states and of the United States Congress by ratifying this Compact, that all state and federal officials enforcing, implementing or administering other state and federal laws affecting the ACT Basin shall, to the maximum extent practicable, enforce, implement or administer those laws in furtherance of the purposes of this Compact and the allocation formula adopted by the Commission insofar as such actions are not in conflict with applicable federal laws.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          Nothing contained in this Compact shall be deemed to restrict the executive powers of the President in the event of a national emergency.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c)
          Nothing contained in this Compact shall impair or affect the constitutional authority of the United States or any of its powers, rights, functions or jurisdiction under other existing or future laws in and over the area or waters which are the subject of the Compact, including projects of the Commission, nor shall any act of the Commission have the effect of repealing, modifying or amending any federal law. All officers, agencies and instrumentalities of the United States shall exercise their powers and authority over water resources in the ACT Basin and water resource facilities, and to the maximum extent practicable, shall exercise their discretion in carrying out their responsibilities, powers, and authorities over water resources in the ACT Basin and water resource facilities in the ACT Basin in a manner consistent with and that effectuates the allocation formula developed pursuant to this Compact or any modification of the allocation formula so long as the actions are not in conflict with any applicable federal law. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, or its successors, and all other federal agencies and instrumentalities shall cooperate with the ACT Basin Commission in accomplishing the purposes of the Compact and fulfilling the obligations of each of the parties to the Compact regarding the allocation formula.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d)
          Once adopted by the two states and ratified by the United States Congress, this Compact shall have the full force and effect of federal law, and shall supersede state and local laws operating contrary to the provisions herein or the purposes of this Compact; provided, however, nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective signatory states relating to water quality, and riparian rights as among persons exclusively within each state.
         </p>
         <p>
          All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public. The signatory parties recognize the importance and necessity of public participation in activities of the Commission, including the development and adoption of the initial allocation formula and any modification thereto. Prior to the adoption of the initial allocation formula, the Commission shall adopt procedures ensuring public participation in the development, review, and approval of the initial allocation formula and any subsequent modification thereto. At a minimum, public notice to interested parties and a comment period shall be provided. The Commission shall respond in writing to relevant comments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commissioners shall serve without compensation from the ACT Basin Commission. All general operational funding required by the Commission and agreed to by the voting members shall obligate each state to pay an equal share of such agreed upon funding. Funds remitted to the Commission by a state in payment of such obligation shall not lapse; provided, however, that if any state fails to remit payment within 90 days after payment is due, such obligation shall terminate and any state which has made payment may have such payment returned. Costs of attendance and participation at meetings of the Commission by the Federal Commissioner shall be paid by the United States.
         </p>
         <p>
          (a)
          In the event of a dispute between the voting members of this Compact involving a claim relating to compliance with the allocation formula adopted by the Commission under this Compact, the following procedures shall govern:
         </p>
         <p>
          (1) Notice of claim shall be filed with the Commission by a voting member of this Compact and served upon each member of the Commission. The notice shall provide a written statement of the claim, including a brief narrative of the relevant matters supporting the claimant's position.
         </p>
         <p>
          (2) Within twenty (20) days of the Commission's receipt of a written statement of a claim, the party or parties to the Compact against whom the complaint is made may prepare a brief narrative of the relevant matters and file it with the Commission and serve it upon each member of the Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          (3) Upon receipt of a claim and any response or responses thereto, the Commission shall convene as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) days from receipt of any response to the claim, and shall determine if a resolution of the dispute is possible.
         </p>
         <p>
          (4) A resolution of a dispute under this Article through unanimous vote of the State Commissioners shall be binding upon the state parties and any state party determined to be in violation of the allocation formula shall correct such violation without delay.
         </p>
         <p>
          (5) If the Commission is unable to resolve the dispute within 10 days from the date of the meeting convened pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this Article, the Commission shall select, by unanimous decision of the voting members of the Commission, an independent mediator to conduct a non-binding mediation of the dispute. The mediator shall not be a resident or domiciliary of any member state, shall not be an employee or agent of any member of the Commission, shall be a person knowledgeable in water resource management issues, and shall disclose any and all current or prior contractual or other relations to any member of the Commission. The expenses of the mediator shall be paid by the Commission. If the mediator becomes unwilling or unable to serve, the Commission by unanimous decision of the voting members of the Commission, shall appoint another independent mediator.
         </p>
         <p>
          (6) If the Commission fails to appoint an independent mediator to conduct a non-binding mediation of the dispute within seventy-five (75) days of the filing of the original claim or within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Commission learns that a mediator is unwilling or unable to serve, the party submitting the claim shall have no further obligation to bring the claim before the Commission and may proceed by pursuing any appropriate remedies, including any and all judicial remedies.
         </p>
         <p>
          (7) If an independent mediator is selected, the mediator shall establish the time and location for the mediation session or sessions and may request that each party to the Compact submit, in writing, to the mediator a statement of its position regarding the issue or issues in dispute. Such statements shall not be exchanged by the parties except upon the unanimous agreement of the parties to the mediation.
         </p>
         <p>
          (8) The mediator shall not divulge confidential information disclosed to the mediator by the parties or by witnesses, if any, in the course of the mediation. All records, reports, or other documents received by a mediator while serving as a mediator shall be considered confidential. The mediator shall not be compelled in any adversary proceeding or judicial forum to divulge the contents of such documents or the fact that such documents exist or to testify in regard to the mediation.
         </p>
         <p>
          (9) Each party to the mediation shall maintain the confidentiality of the information received during the mediation and shall not rely on or introduce in any judicial proceeding as evidence:
         </p>
         <p>
          a. Views expressed or suggestions made by another party regarding a settlement of the dispute;
         </p>
         <p>
          b. Proposals made or views expressed by the mediator; or
         </p>
         <p>
          c. The fact that another party to the hearing had or had not indicated a willingness to accept a proposal for settlement of the dispute.
         </p>
         <p>
          (10) The mediator may terminate the non-binding mediation session or sessions whenever, in the judgment of the mediator, further efforts to resolve the dispute would not lead to a resolution of the dispute between or among the parties. Any party to the dispute may terminate the mediation process at any time by giving written notification to the mediator and the Commission. If terminated prior to reaching a resolution, the party submitting the original claim to the Commission shall have no further obligation to bring its claim before the Commission and may proceed by pursuing any appropriate remedies, including any and all judicial remedies.
         </p>
         <p>
          (11) The mediator shall have no authority to require the parties to enter into a settlement of any dispute regarding the Compact. The mediator may simply attempt to assist the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of their dispute. The mediator is authorized to conduct joint and separate meetings with the parties to the mediation and to make oral or written recommendations for a settlement of the dispute.
         </p>
         <p>
          (12) At any time during the mediation process, the Commission is encouraged to take whatever steps it deems necessary to assist the mediator or the parties to resolve the dispute.
         </p>
         <p>
          (13) In the event of a proceeding seeking enforcement of the allocation formula, this Compact creates a cause of action solely for equitable relief. No action for money damages may be maintained. The party or parties alleging a violation of the Compact shall have the burden of proof.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          In the event of a dispute between any voting member and the United States relating to a state's noncompliance with the allocation formula as a result of actions or a refusal to act by officers, agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, the provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this Article (other than the provisions of subparagraph (a)(4)) shall apply.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c)
          The United States may initiate dispute resolution under paragraph (a) in the same manner as other parties to this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d)
          Any signatory party who is affected by any action of the Commission, other than the adoption or enforcement of or compliance with the allocation formula, may file a complaint before the ACT Basin Commission seeking to enforce any provision of this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          (1) The Commission shall refer the dispute to an independent hearing officer or mediator, to conduct a hearing or mediation of the dispute. If the parties are unable to settle their dispute through mediation, a hearing shall be held by the Commission or its designated hearing officer. Following a hearing conducted by a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall submit a report to the Commission setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law, and making recommendations to the Commission for the resolution of the dispute.
         </p>
         <p>
          (2) The Commission may adopt or modify the recommendations of the hearing officer within 60 days of submittal of the report. If the Commission is unable to reach unanimous agreement on the resolution of the dispute within 60 days of submittal of the report with the concurrence of the Federal Commissioner in disputes involving or affecting federal interests, the affected party may file an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this Compact. The hearing officer's report shall be of no force and effect and shall not be admissible as evidence in any further proceedings.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e)
          All actions under this Article shall be subject to the following provisions:
         </p>
         <p>
          (1) The Commission shall adopt guidelines and procedures for the appointment of hearing officers or independent mediators to conduct all hearings and mediations required under this Article. The hearing officer or mediator appointed under this Article shall be compensated by the Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          (2) All hearings or mediations conducted under this article may be conducted utilizing the Federal Administrative Procedures Act, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Federal Rules of Evidence. The Commission may also choose to adopt some or all of its own procedural and evidentiary rules for the conduct of hearings or mediations under this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          (3) Any action brought under this Article shall be limited to equitable relief only. This Compact shall not give rise to a cause of action for money damages.
         </p>
         <p>
          (4) Any signatory party bringing an action before the Commission under this Article shall have the burdens of proof and persuasion.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Commission may, upon unanimous decision, bring an action against any person to enforce any provision of this Compact, other than the adoption or enforcement of or compliance with the allocation formula, in any court of competent jurisdiction.
         </p>
         <p>
          This Compact shall not be construed as establishing any general principle or precedent applicable to any other interstate streams.
         </p>
         <p>
          The provisions of this Compact shall not interfere with the right or power of any state to regulate the use and control of water within the boundaries of the state, providing such state action is not inconsistent with the allocation formula.
         </p>
         <p>
          (a)
          The States of Alabama and Georgia mutually agree to the principle of individual State efforts to control man-made water pollution from sources located and operating within each State and to the continuing support of each State in active water pollution control programs.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b)
          The States of Alabama and Georgia agree to cooperate, through their appropriate State agencies, in the investigation, abatement, and control of sources of alleged interstate pollution within the ACT River Basin whenever such sources are called to their attention by the Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c)
          The States of Alabama and Georgia agree to cooperate in maintaining the quality of the waters of the ACT River Basin.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d)
          The States of Alabama and Georgia agree that no State may require another state to provide water for the purpose of water quality control as a substitute for or in lieu of adequate waste treatment.
         </p>
         <p>
          No state shall acquire any right or expectation to the use of water because of any other state's failure to use the full amount of water allocated to it under this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          If any portion of this Compact is held invalid for any reason, the remaining portions, to the fullest extent possible, shall be severed from the void portion and given the fullest possible force, effect, and application.
         </p>
         <p>
          Notice of ratification of this Compact by the legislature of each state shall promptly be given by the Governor of the ratifying state to the Governor of the other participating state. When the two state legislatures have ratified the Compact, notice of their mutual ratification shall be forwarded to the Congressional delegation of the signatory states for submission to the Congress of the United States for ratification. When the Compact is ratified by the Congress of the United States, the President, upon signing the federal ratification legislation, shall promptly notify the Governors of the participating states and appoint the Federal Commissioner. The Compact shall be signed by all three Commissioners as their first order of business at their first meeting and shall be filed of record in the party states."

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the director, upon receipt of evidence that a project is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, may bring an action as provided in Code Section 12-12-14 to restrain immediately any person causing or contributing to the alleged danger or to take such other action as may be necessary.

      The General Assembly finds that there is a need for sewage holding tanks to accommodate the sewage from flush toilets which serve the needs of employees at construction sites during the temporary period of construction and the needs of the public at special events, and that such sewage holding tanks should be regulated to ensure that they are maintained in a clean, sanitary, and functional condition for the protection of human health, safety, and welfare. Where such sewage holding tanks are utilized, their construction, maintenance, and operation shall meet the standards of this article and all health and safety regulations applicable thereto.
