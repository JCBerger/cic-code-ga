      The enactment of this Code is intended as a recodification, revision, modernization, and reenactment of the general laws of the State of Georgia which are currently of force and is intended, where possible, to resolve conflicts which exist in the law and to repeal those laws which are obsolete as a result of the passage of time or other causes, which have been declared unconstitutional or invalid, or which have been superseded by the enactment of later laws. Except as otherwise specifically provided by particular provisions of this Code, the enactment of this Code by the General Assembly is not intended to alter the substantive law in existence on the effective date of this Code.

        Three-minute rule remains unchanged.
       </b>
       - Although the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) specifically repealed the Code of 1933, the Rules of the Superior Court were not a part of that repealed code even though they "conveniently" appeared therein. The three-minute rule is one of long standing, originally promulgated pursuant to authority given by law and never specifically repealed by the General Assembly. As such, the three-minute rule remains viable and unchanged by the adoption of the O.C.G.A. Hinson v. Castellio,

        Section normally states existing law.
       </b>
       - While it is true that the adoption by the General Assembly of the Code of 1933 amounted to a reenactment of each section thereof as contemporary statutes, it is also true that in construing the meaning of an ambiguous section, the original Act will be looked to in order to determine the true interpretation of the section; and in such an interpretation of an ambiguous section having the force of a statute, unless the contrary manifestly appears from the words employed, the language of such section should be construed as intending to state the previously existing law, and not to change it.

       Unless contrary manifestly appears from words employed, section should be understood as stating existing law, and not changing it. Maddox v. First Nat'l Bank,

       Where, by the language of the section itself, its context, and by reason of the expressed subject matter under which it is grouped, it becomes proper and necessary to determine the true intent of the legislative body, it will be construed in the light of the source from which it came, to the extent that the language of the section itself may be compatible with such a construction; in such a case, where the section has been codified from a decision of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, the section will be construed, insofar as is compatible with its terms, so as to conform to the then existing law, rather than to change the rule in force at the time the Code was adopted.

        Related sections should be construed to harmonize each other.
       </b>
       - The adoption of the Code of 1933 amounted to a reenactment of each section as contemporary statutes of the state, and each section should be dealt with as though it were contained in the same Act of the General Assembly and should be construed as if it was a separate paragraph of the same statute. Therefore, sections relating to the same subject matter and codified at the same time should be construed, if possible, to harmonize with each other, and that construction should be adopted which will prevent a contradiction by one section of the other, so that both will be operative.

       - Where two sections of the Code are found to be in irreconcilable conflict, and both sections are derived from Acts of the General Assembly, this conflict must be settled by resort to the original Acts from which the conflicting sections are derived, and that section which is derived from the later Act of the General Assembly must control.

      "(5) Article I, Section I, Paragraphs I and II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia affirm that '[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property except by due process of law'; and that '[p]rotection to person and property is the paramount duty of government and shall be impartial and complete.

        - Though a victim of sexual assault was mentally and physically disabled, a trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in determining that the victim was competent to testify against the defendant at the defendant's criminal trial because the trial court held a competency hearing and found that the victim understood the victim's responsibility to tell the truth and clearly knew what had happened, who had done it, and so communicated those facts, despite the victim's mental and physical disabilities.

     <p>
      The law prescribes certain ages at which persons shall be considered of sufficient maturity to discharge certain civil functions, to make contracts, and to dispose of property. Prior to those ages they are minors and are, on account of that disability, unable to exercise these rights as citizens unless such minor becomes emancipated by operation of law or pursuant to Article 10 of Chapter 11 of Title 15.

        Entire will not invalidated by creation of void legacy for enemy alien wife.
       </b>
       - If a wife was an alien enemy, and as such could not be a beneficiary under a will, then the nomination of her as a beneficiary would have amounted to no more than the creation of a void legacy. In such a case, the effect of the invalidity of the legacy is to render the legacy void, but not to invalidate the entire will, and it is no ground of caveat to the probate of a will that a devise to a particular person may be void.

         One of two provisos should not be rejected as senseless or superfluous.
        </b>
        - The rule of construction that effect is to be given to all the words of a statute forbids that two provisos should be treated as having no more scope or significance than one of them would have if standing alone. It is better to wait for a legislative amendment than to arbitrarily reject one of the provisos as senseless or superfluous. Butterworth v. Butterworth,

        - It is an elementary rule of statutory construction that a statute must be construed in relation to other statutes of which it is a part, and all statutes relating to the same subject matter, briefly called statutes "in pari materia," are construed together and harmonized wherever possible, so as to ascertain the legislative intendment and give effect thereto.

       <p>
        Paragraph (d)(3) of this section is a rule of statutory construction, and does not apply to contractual limitations; yet, this section states a rule of reason with respect to limitations, be they statutory or contractual, which should be applied to limitations in contracts in the absence of any sound reason for not applying them.

        An "accident," in a strict legal sense, as applied to negligence cases, refers to an event which is not proximately caused by negligence, but instead arises from an unforeseen or unexplained cause. But it is also often used to indicate a happening which, although not wholly free from negligence by some person, was not proximately caused by the failure of either of the parties to a case to exercise ordinary care in the situation.

        - Where there was evidence that the attorney who prepared the will enabled the testatrix, who because of the testatrix's physical condition could not write, to make the testatrix's mark by placing the testatrix's hand upon the pen as the mark was made, this was sufficient to authorize the jury to find that the testatrix "signed" the will.

        - Where a railroad company blocks with its cars a crossing on a public highway for a needless or unreasonable length of time, a pedestrian, after waiting a reasonable time for the cars to be removed, may turn aside to avoid the obstruction and pass over the property of the company without being a "trespasser" in so doing.

        - In an action against a utility and power company for damages on theories of "trespass" and nuisance arising from electromagnetic radiation, a grant of summary judgment on the trespass claim and directed verdict on the nuisance claim were proper for policy reasons since the scientific evidence was inconclusive regarding the invasive quality of magnetic fields from power lines.

     <p>
      Laws prescribe only for the future; they cannot impair the obligation of contracts nor, ordinarily, have a retrospective operation. Laws looking only to the remedy or mode of trial may apply to contracts, rights, and offenses entered into, accrued, or committed prior to their passage; but in every case a reasonable time subsequent to the passage of the law should be allowed for the citizen to enforce his contract or to protect his right.

        - While it is the rule that no one has a vested right in a mere mode of procedure, so that a statute merely regulating procedure and leaving untouched all the substantial protections with which existing law surrounds the person accused of a crime is not within the constitutional inhibition against ex post facto laws, yet a statute is void and ineffective as related to previous offenses if it takes from the accused a substantial right given to the accused by the law in force at the time to which the accused's guilt relates, and such a statute cannot be sustained simply because, in a general sense, it may be said to regulate procedure.

       - Generally, laws take effect from the date of their enactment and ignorance of the law is no excuse; thus, the contention of the petitioners that they were surprised by an amendment pleading an Act approved after the suit was instituted is without merit, and the trial judge did not abuse the judge's discretion in refusing to continue the case to the next term.

     <p>
      Laws made for the preservation of public order or good morals may not be dispensed with or abrogated by any agreement. However, a person may waive or renounce what the law has established in his favor when he does not thereby injure others or affect the public interest.

         Comity requires that state courts be afforded opportunity to perform duties.
        </b>
        - Although the states are sovereign entities, they are bound along with their officials, including their judges, by the United States Constitution and the federal statutory law. Principles of comity in the United States federal system require that the state courts be afforded the opportunity to perform their duty, which includes responding to attacks on state authority based on the federal law, or, if the litigation is wholly private, construing and applying the applicable federal requirements.

       The General Assembly finds that a Georgia family's proud tradition of racing began in Dawsonville, Georgia, under the tutelage and guiding hand of George Elliott.  George's young son Bill began to demonstrate at an early age a natural skill and competitive racing instinct at Dixie Speedway in Woodstock, and in 1976, at the tender age of 20, Bill Elliott entered his first Winston Cup race and launched a career that would span decades. Awesome Bill from Dawsonville, a modest, unassuming, and unpretentious man, has become a household name in NASCAR racing and has been selected Most Popular Driver an unprecedented 16 times, Georgia Professional Athlete of the Year twice, National Motorsports Driver of the Year 14 times, and in 1998, was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. It is virtually impossible to list all of the honors and awards Million Dollar Bill has garnered over his incandescent career, but perhaps his most acclaimed accomplishment is his support, love, and respect from racing fans.  He has given unstintingly of his time, talents, energy, and financial resources to numerous charities including the Special Olympics, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation and it is abundantly fitting and proper that this extraordinary Georgian be recognized in a special and lasting manner.

       The members of the General Assembly  commend Bill Elliott for his over 30 years of outstanding contributions to the sport of racing and designate October 8 of each year as "Bill Elliott Day" in Georgia.

     <p>
      "(1) The Georgia Water Quality Control Act was passed by the Georgia General Assembly and signed into law in 1964 by Governor Carl Sanders;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2)
      At that time, there were 25 communities in Georgia which had no public sewer systems, 40 communities with a sewer system but no treatment facilities, 60 communities with a sewer system but only primary treatment facilities, 50 communities with a sewer system and secondary treatment facilities which were in need of improvement, and 395 industries which had documented untreated or inadequately treated discharges to Georgia's surface waters;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3)
      At the time of passage of the Act, many of Georgia's surface waters were extremely polluted, and serious water quality problems existed all over the State of Georgia;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4)
      The state established the Georgia Water Quality Control Board (later reconstituted as the Georgia Environmental Protection Division as a result of the 1972 Reorganization of State Government under Governor Jimmy Carter), and Governor Sanders appointed R.S. 'Rock' Howard to be the board's executive secretary;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) By the time the Federal Water Quality Control Act was passed in 1972, most of Georgia's industries had been brought into compliance with the initial requirements of the federal Act;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Over the ensuing four decades, billions of federal, state, and local dollars have been invested in planning, designing, and constructing modern publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities throughout this state;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7)
      Georgia's water professionals are committed to operating these facilities to maintain consistent compliance with extremely stringent standards;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8)
      Both publicly and privately owned facilities have performed so well that they are no longer the most significant threat to Georgia's waters;
